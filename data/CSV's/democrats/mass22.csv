54, They marveled at our success as a Commonwealth
55, They spoke about our challenges and oursetbacks
56,"But mostly, they focused on our opportunities to be better, to do better, together"
57,Each one asked us to ﬁnd the courage to compromise

86, Increased local aid to schools andcommunities
87, Cut taxes for working families
88," Invested hundreds of millions of dollars alongside billions ofdollars of private sector investments in housing, downtown development, waterfront and port operations, andjob-creating business expansions"
89,And that Rainy Day Fund grew from $1 billion to $5 billion among the largest ﬁscal safety nets in the country
90,"As we rolled into calendar year 2020, we had the highest number of people working in state history, wagegains at every level of the economy, and hundreds of thousands of new jobs"

92,And then came COVID
93,We all know the past 22 months have been tough
94," We’ve all suﬀered some degree of loss, disruption,confusion, anger and isolation"
95,But the people of Massachusetts did what they always do
96," They collaborated, created, reimagined, and madethe unbearable bearable"
97,"On so many issues, Massachusetts led the way"
98,We had the largest small business grant program in the country
99,"Constructed with the state legislature, this program funneled $700 million to over 15,000 small businesses"
100,The vast majority were owner-operated

122, 5
123,"2million people are fully vaccinated, and about half of them have already received a booster shot"
124, We are anational leader
125,"Throughout this pandemic, there’s been no shortage of things we just don’t know, and it’s easy to get lost inthat"
126,But we should also remember what we do know
127, Vaccines and all the other resources we have now work
128," Thechance of suﬀering serious illness if someone is vaccinated is very, very small"
129,Special shout out to the vaccinators from across the Commonwealth who stepped up to support their fellowresidents
130,Thousands of people got this done and made it possible for Massachusetts to be a national leader in thiscritical eﬀort
131, It’s the most reliable and fastest path toward normal
132,"I asked former East Boston Neighborhood Health Center CEO Manny Lopes and Gladys Vega, ExecutiveDirector of La Collaborativa in Chelsea, to join us tonight"
133,"Their partnership, and the trust they’ve earned over many years in Chelsea, Revere and Everett, made a majordiﬀerence there"

135,We’re so grateful for all the work your teams have done to keep people safe
136, Thank you
137,There’s an old expression about what you learn about people when they are truly tested
138,"Well – for the past two years, the people, institutions and communities of this Commonwealth have mostdeﬁnitely been tested"
139," Time and time again you have adjusted, and you have responded"
140,"Together, we set the course for a comeback– and it’s working"

146,"As we enter the new year, there are many important opportunities to build on the collaborative work we’vedone over the past seven"
147,Two of those opportunities are closing loopholes that threaten public safety
148,"The ﬁrst loophole allows those charged with violent crimes, who may also have lengthy criminal records, towalk free before trial"
149,"And the second leaves residents, many of them women, with little recourse when an ex-partner attempts toviolate them and destroy their lives"
150,"We've ﬁled bills to deal with these issues three times, to no avail"
151, The time to do something about this is longpast
152,The Lieutenant Governor and I recently listened to several women tell us their survival stories
153, It was one ofthe most diﬃcult conversations we’ve ever been part of
154,"One after another, these women described, in graphic detail, how they survived multiple physical andpsychological assaults, and how these loopholes actually protected the men who were terrorizing them"
155,It was awful
156,Current law is clearly not working
157," These women were bothered, battered, bruised and beaten time and timeagain by their abusers, and nothing changed"
158, We felt their desperation
159,It would be impossible to listen to their stories and walk away believing the Commonwealth is serious aboutprotecting these women
160,"Another woman came forward to detail how an ex-partner, unbeknownst to her, had taken dozens of lewdpictures of her and posted them on the internet"
161,"And if it couldn’t get any more awful, she then saw the note from him on the website: “video coming soon"
162,"”A lifetime of relationships, a small business she owned, a basic sense of privacy we all take for granted, wereshattered by one man’s despicable actions"
163,Massachusetts is one of only two states that doesn’t treat this as a crime
164, 48 other states treat this as a crime
165,Because it is a crime
166,These women had the courage to come forward and publicly tell their stories
167, They deserve to be heard
168, Andthey and the women they speak for deserve a vote on these two pieces of legislation
169,"As we come out of the pandemic, we know we have a mental health crisis"
170,"Like many things, it was there before COVID arrived"
171," But the anxiety, disruption and the isolation that camewith COVID has made it worse and more visible"

175,"gov/news/governor-baker-delivers-2022-state-of-the-commonwealth-address7/11Before the pandemic, we ﬁled a health care reform bill that would improve access to mental health services"
176,"Some pieces of it, like telehealth, became important parts of our eﬀort to expand access to care during thepandemic"
177," Since that time, the legislature has written telehealth into state law"
178, But many other parts of that2019 proposal have not been addressed
179,"The message remains the same: the healthcare system doesn’t value behavioral health services, primary careand geriatric services"
180," As a result, there are enormous staﬀ and clinician shortages in exactly the areas of carethat we need most"
181,"We know the legislature cares deeply about this issue, and we look forward to working with you to ﬁnish thiswork during this legislative session"
182,"We also appreciated the chance to testify recently before the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities& Energy on our fourth climate proposal"
183, This one builds on our very successful oﬀshore wind agenda andincludes the creation of a $750 million Clean Energy Innovation Fund
184,There are big ideas looking for a chance to test themselves in our academic institutions and our cutting-edgeresearch organizations

194," We know there is much to do, and we need to movequickly"
195,"In addition, we’ll soon ﬁle a transportation bond bill to ensure we get the full beneﬁt of the federal BipartisanInfrastructure Law"
196,"As you know, accessing these federal dollars requires state government to authorize the funds that will pay forour share of federally approved projects"
197,"Smart, disciplined ﬁscal management has made it possible for us to maximize federal participation in dozensof projects"
198," There’s a long list of opportunities here, but a big piece of these funds will be awarded through acompetitive process"
199,We need to move quickly to secure these dollars
200,Fiscal discipline also makes it possible for us to make strategic decisions about tax fairness and ourcompetitive position
201,The pandemic has proven that we now live in a new world where people have more ﬂexibility about where theylive and work
202,"To encourage our citizens to continue to call Massachusetts home and to help those struggling to make endsmeet because of rising inﬂation, we’ll ﬁle several tax breaks in our budget proposal later this week"

207,The past two years have been very diﬃcult ones for families
208," Our budget doubles the tax break for childrenand dependents, because every Massachusetts family deserves a break"
209," We’ll also ask lawmakers to eliminate income taxes for the lowest paid 230,000 taxpayers here in theCommonwealth"
210," Instead of paying income taxes, these people should be able to use their earnings to pay fornecessities, like food, housing and transportation"
211,Rents are also rising while wages remain relatively ﬂat
212, It’s time to give renters a bigger tax break on theirmonthly payments
213,It’s also been a tough two years for seniors
214, We’ll ask the legislature to give them a break on their propertytaxes and make our estate tax more competitive with the rest of the country
215,We’ve asked the people of Massachusetts to do a lot these past few years
216, It's time for us to invest in Massachusetts families
217, To give them back some of the tax revenue they createdthrough their hard work
218,"Before I close out my remarks tonight, I want to thank a few more people"
219,"It’s been a very long two years for everyone, but it’s been an especially diﬃcult period for anyone who has to“go to work"
220,”Many people have been able to work from home and continue to get the job done
221,"But our friends and neighbors in health care, senior care, education, retail, hospitality, emergency response,public works, public safety, restaurant, food service, grocery, transportation, and a huge number of other ﬁeldshad to show up"
222, And they did every single day
223,"Their work and commitment, their patience and their grace, throughout all this has been extraordinary"
224, Canwe give all those folks the round of applause they so richly deserve?Thank you

249,One of those lost that day was Massachusetts’ own Marine Corps Sergeant Johanny Rosario Pichardo

252, And she paid for it with her life

260,"In the fall of 2018, we were rocked by a natural gas explosion that shut down Lawrence, North Andover andAndover"
261,"18 year-old Leonel Rondon tragically died that day, and many others were severely injured"
262," Everything in mostof Andover, Lawrence and North Andover ground to a halt"
263,Many members of our team practically lived in makeshift command centers alongside hundreds of emergencyresponse and construction personnel for several months as we worked feverishly to repair the damage
264,"It was an avalanche of issues, problems and decisions that didn’t stop for weeks, but we worked through it"
265,"To this day, I think a big part of our success was due to the relationships we already had with most of the keyleaders who were involved"
266,The Lieutenant Governor and I knew the local oﬃcials and the state legislators
267, We knew the utility companies
268,We knew the contractors
269, And they all knew us
270,We trusted each other
271, And that trust made much of what we got done over the next three months possible
272,There’s no collaboration without trust

280,"Today, it’s clearly more diﬃcult to build trust, to collaborate in public life than it once was"
281,"The explosion of social media, the arrival of hundreds of news channels and information distributionplatforms"
282, And the ongoing churn of information have made it almost impossible for anyone in public life whowants to collaborate to build trust
283,Facts are often fungible and curated
284, Missteps play out in real time and can go viral in the most bizarre andunusual ways
285, Context is non-existent
286," And in many cases, history and current events get twisted to supportwhatever point of view someone is advocating for"
287,But the answer to the swirl and chaos of modern life is not more of the same poisonous brew
288,The answer is to stand up and accept the responsibility that comes with the work
289, To understand that trust isearned and collaboration is how diﬃcult things get done
290,Many of the projects we’ve worked on with our colleagues in local government would never have happenedwithout trust
291, Many of the most important pieces of legislation we’ve enacted over the past seven years wouldnot have happened without trust
292,Trust is where possibility in public life comes from
293,"If you can’t tell someone you work with, partner with, or collaborate with, what you really think it’s very hard todo small things"
294, Much less big ones
295,"Here in Massachusetts, we’ve done big things and small ones"
296,"At a time when so much of our public dialogue is designed to destroy trust, to manipulate facts, and to pullpeople apart"
297," We’ve partnered with one another, and shared success and blame along the way"
298,"We should continue to focus on building and maintaining positive, collaborative relationships"
299, Because theywork for the people we serve and it’s what most voters expect from us
300,They want us to work hard and collaborate the same way they do
301," To listen to them as if they were ourneighbors, because they are"
302, To appreciate their life stories the same way we expect them to appreciate ours
