3,govGovernor Glenn Youngkin DeliversAddress to the Joint AssemblyAs prepared for Delivery Good afternoon
4,"Standing here before you, and looking around this room, I’m struck by thehistory that’s been made in this place, the people’s house"
5,As well as the fact that the work you do here has great consequence for thepeople of Virginia
6, And so it is as we gather here today
7,Governor of VirginiaGlenn YoungkinMr
8," Speaker, Madam President, Lt"
9," Governor Earle-Sears, Chief JusticeGoodwyn, and Justices of the Supreme Court, members of the GeneralAssembly, my fellow Virginians, today we begin anew, all of us together"
10,"After years of fractured politics, a deadly pandemic, lives and livelihoods lost,soaring mental health incidents and drug overdoses, rising crime rates, ever-increasing costs for housing, food and fuel, Virginians have sent us here toturn the page"
11,They came out in record numbers to make their voice heard
12, They chose anew vision for the future
13,"Today, I want to speak to that vision and begin our partnership to address thepriorities of the people"
14,I’ve enjoyed getting to know so many of the members of these two legislativebodies both Republicans and Democrats
15,You have invited me to your homes
16, We’ve shared meals together
17, We’vedone community service together
18, And I thank you for that
19,We’re all part of Team Virginia
20,"And as I shared on Saturday, we can take inspiration from Dr"
21," Martin LutherKing’s life which we celebrate today and his words that “we may have allcome on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now"
22,"”The work we have to do, we must do together"
23,"And there isn’t a better example of people coming together on behalf ofVirginia than the brave crews, the law enforcement heroes, and the firstresponders who worked during yesterday’s storm in the freezing cold, ice andsnow to keep our streets safe, the lights on and our hospitals open"
24,"Before I speak to the work ahead, I want to recognize someone who hastraveled with me every step of the way"
25,She inspired me to live a life of faith as a younger man
26, She is an example ofhumility and strength not just to our children but to women across this greatcommonwealth
27,"She is the best partner I could ever imagine our First Lady, SuzanneYoungkin"
28,"After a year of campaigning at diners, senior centers, schools, housingprojects, courthouses…even pickup basketball games, I’ve taken the measureof our people"
29,"I’ve found them to be resilient, optimistic, courageous"
30, I listened to theirhopes and concerns their dreams and fears
31, Their stories of inspiration andstories of tragedy
32,Some cried on my shoulders
33, Some prayed over me
34, And some spoke bluntlymaybe a little too bluntly at times
35,Almost all expressed a desire for a Virginia worthy of the ambitions of itspeople
36,I come here today to echo their clarion call for change
37,To form a government that works for ordinary citizens
38, That’s a catalyst foropportunity and not an obstacle
39, And that addresses the kitchen tableconcerns of working families that are real and mounting
40,It’s been said that all great change starts at kitchen tables across America
41,"You see, that’s where families talk about what matters to them"
42, It’s also whereparents discuss their worries stagnant wages in the face of rising expensescaring for an elderly parent and trying to find a way to save for their kids’future
43,I want to share with you something that we’ve all heard from voters
44,They’re genuinely concerned that the cold halls of government aredisconnected from the cold realities families face while sitting at their kitchentables every day
45,"In that respect, we shouldn’t misconstrue record revenue for government aseconomic success for Virginians"
46,"The view from the people, whose labor generates those tax receipts is quitedifferent than the talk in Richmond"
47,They see an economy whose growth has stalled at less than 1% per year for 8years
48, With household incomes stagnating over the last year --- as the costof living has sky-rocketed
49,"They see declining schools, they see violent crime reports dominating thenews, they see record low labor participation, they see small businessesstruggling, and they see government failures and encroachments on theirliberties"
50,From the perspective of every day Virginia families times are tough
51, And thestate of our Commonwealth is not what it should be
52,Today we’re at the proverbial “tipping point” where the cash flow to thegovernment from rising tax burdens is very high
53,"And yet the impact of high costs and high taxes, and an increased regulatoryburden are clearly being felt in the real economy and the real lives ofVirginians"
54,The good news is that we have the ability to course-correct before this poorperformance becomes permanent
55,With current and projected tax driven surpluses we can lower the tax burdenson Virginia families
56,"And make crucial investments in those critical pillars to the great Virginiapromise of a lower cost-of-living, excellent schools, safe communities, a rip-roaring economy that lifts up all Virginians, and a state government thatworks for Virginians"
57,"To do that, I’m asking each of us in this body Republican and Democrat aliketo come together"
58,"To rise above the Richmond of divisive, special interest politics, the small andthe parochial to usher in a sweeping vision of changeAnd to put this commonwealth on a pathway to prosperity"
59,"On day one, we hit the ground running, signing 11 executive actions, andswearing in a full cabinet, outstanding individuals, who are qualified andshare Virginia’s values"
60,"As of today, we’ve worked with legislators to introduce 59 pieces oflegislation to tackle our day one agenda"
61,And we’ll be submitting a package of 25 budget amendments to reflect ourbipartisan priorities
62,We’re addressing issues that are critical to the future of this commonwealth
63,And that every member in this chamber can get behind
64,Virginians have given us a license to lead
65, They have charged us all to deliveron a Day One agenda
66,We know on some issues there’ll be deep disagreement
67,But I believe this chamber is big enough for us to talk through ourdifferences
68, And there is more that binds us than divides us
69,For we all share a common goal to leave a better Virginia for our children
70,We’re going to start by investing in Virginia classrooms
71,Education is the key to opportunity
72, The means by which all children and theirparents can realize their greatest dreams
73,Virginia schools have a lofty reputation
74, But lately we’ve not lived up to thatreputation
75,"In fact, our education standards for math and reading are now the lowest inthe nation"
76,Unelected political appointees lowered standards which inevitably led to adecline in student performance
77,"60% of our students don’t meet national proficiency standards, including over70% of Latino students, and over 80% of black students, failing to meetstandard on the math NAEP tests"
78," Remarkably, despite these dramaticdeclines noted by the National Center for Education Statistics only oneVirginia school has been deemed failingbecause accreditation standards were lowered"
79,Starting now we’re ending the accountability shell games intended to makeus feel good but amount to the often stated “soft bigotry of lowexpectations
80,”Let’s stop cheating our kids
81,On this we should join arms and purpose together so that when our time hereis done we’ll collectively have raised education standards from the lowest tothe highest in the nation
82,I’m also calling for $150 million to help us meet our goal of starting 20 newcharter schools
83,"Whether they’re called charter schools, lab schools, or schools of innovation– it doesn’t really matter"
84,I don’t care what we call it I just care that we do it
85,We’re joined today by the students of Green Run Collegiate Charter School inVirginia Beach
86, Green Run Collegiate shares a facility with Green Run HighSchool
87,They have an innovative curriculum
88, They provide access to every child in theschool district to attend the collegiate program
89, They’re thriving and theirparents are thrilled
90,Please join me in welcoming these future Virginia leaders to ourcommonwealth’s capitol
91,We’re going to build partnerships between the commonwealth and our greatuniversities to create lab schools of excellence
92,It could be a lab school in Southwest Virginia in partnership with UVA Wise
93,It could be an entrepreneurship or entertainment industry-focused schoolpartnering with one of our amazing historically black colleges anduniversities
94,Or a partnership with Old Dominion University for opportunities in offshorewind development or maritime projects
95,"When it comes to the education budget, I’ve heard consistent bipartisanagreement from all of you that the budget you’ll pass, and that I’ll sign willreflect a record investment in education including a significant boost inteacher pay"
96,With the exception of a parent or guardian no one impacts the future of ayoung child more than a quality teacher
97,We will attract quality professionals to Virginia schools
98, And we will payteachers as the professionals they are
99,We must also recognize that the people most responsible for a child’seducation are parents
100,"My message to parents is this,You have a fundamental right, enshrined in law by this General Assembly, tomake decisions with regard to your child’s upbringing, education and care"
101,And we will protect and reassert that right
102,"Hear me clearly when parents are empowered and engaged, a child’s life isenhanced"
103,I’ve heard the concerns of parents about curriculum
104,"Virginia parents want our history – all of our history, the good and the bad tobe taught"
105," And they want their children to be told how to think, not what tothink"
106,That’s why we should not use inherently divisive concepts like Critical RaceTheory in Virginia
107, And why we should not be teaching our children to seeeverything through the lens of race
108,That’s also why I want to give parents the right to be informed before theirchild is exposed to sexually explicit materials
109,"Please, send me the same bill you passed on a bipartisan basis in 2017 and Iwill sign it"
110,"The classroom environment must be safe, so children can learn"
111,I’m asking members of this general assembly to prioritize school safety byputting a school resource officer on every campus
112,I also ask you to join me in protecting students from sex traffickingorganizations that recruit them on and off campus
113,Let’s train educators to see the signs of trafficking
114, And to stand in the gapfor children at risk of being preyed upon
115,Let’s also involve local law enforcement agencies in the approval of schoolsafety audits
116,And whenever someone preys upon a child in a Virginia school --- we mustrequire it to be reported to local law enforcement for investigation
117,No more cover-ups
118, No more sweeping it under the rug
119, Parents deserve toknow if their child is at risk
120,"Schools exist for the educational benefit of children, and for that reason theymust remain open"
121," I strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated forCovid-19, and get the booster"
122,"As we battle covid, its parents that should decide the health measures takenfor their children"
123,That is why I signed an executive order that allows parents to opt out of maskmandates in schools
124, This is a matter of individual liberty
125,"Again, this body passed a law that protects parent’s fundamental right tomake decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of theirchildren"
126,And health care workers should get to make those decisions too
127,And I will continue to oppose President Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate forhealth workers as we continue to fight a crisis of staffing in Virginia’shealthcare system
128,Our fight against COVID
129,That means no more mandates and no more shut downs
130, As I said onSaturday it means Virginia is open for business
131,It also means the science since the beginning of the pandemic has not beenstatic
132, We now have therapeutics better testing protocols and fortunately aless severe variant
133,And of course we have vaccines
134," It means, educating our friends andneighbors and encouraging them to get the vaccine and the booster"
135,There are 1
136,6 million unvaccinated Virginians today
137,"And speaking to you as your Governor, I’ll never tell you what you must do"
138,But speaking to you as a friend and a neighbor I strongly encourage you toget the vaccine
139,The data is clear people who do not get the vaccine are four times as likely tobe hospitalized
140,"The vaccine will not only help keep people out of the hospital, it will also keeppeople working, earning a paycheck and growing our economy, somethingthat has to remain a top priority for us all"
141,Our Day One Plan will jump-start jobs
142,We’re going to repeal needless regulations
143, We’re going to invest in jobtraining
144, We’re going to foster innovation
145, And we’re going to win thecompetition for jobs and corporate re-locations
146,I support a significant investment in mega-sites
147,"To make sure we don’t lose the next advanced battery manufacturing plantafter seeing several go to Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia"
148,And while we’re at it let’s broaden the baseball stadium authority to includefootball
149, And perhaps we’ll get one of those too
150,I want our rural Virginians to know we’re spreading prosperity far and wide
151,And rural Virginia won’t be left behind
152,"We’re not only bringing jobs, we’re bringing high-speed broadband"
153,Every governor for the last decade has stood in this chamber and told youthat rural broadband was a priority
154, This time we’re going to get it done
155,We’re also going to make certain that key projects at our ports and ourhighways are completed
156,"So the message is clear, if your cargo container ships is stuck off the coast ofanother state come to Virginia"
157,We’re ready for your business
158, And we won’t make supply chain problemsworse with regulatory red tape
159,"And let me be clear, I believe in the fundamental right to work"
160,If anyone tries to bring me a bill that creates forced unionization it will meetthe business end of my veto pen
161,"The states around us have created more jobs, grown their economies faster,and took steps years ago that we must take now, lower taxes, business-friendly regulations, workforce development and more"
162,"This is a real competition, and to win, we have to “play to win"
163,”One of the other challenges businesses face especially small businesses isthe high cost of providing health care for their employees
164,"Over the last three years, you sent the governor eight versions of anassociation health plan bill to make it easier for workers to get health care"
165,It was vetoed eight times
166, Pass that bill again and I will sign it
167,"Virginians are struggling with the high cost of living, in a commonwealth withskyrocketing housing costs, rising fuel prices, and the silent wage theft ofinflation"
168,There are economic fundamentals we don’t control in Virginia – that must bedealt with at the federal level
169,But Washington continues to fiddle in the face of real supply chainchallenges
170, And allows our nation to be overly-reliant on China for criticalgoods and services
171,But there is one vital thing we can do to help Virginians
172," And that is removesome of the tax burden --- added on top of rising prices for groceries,gasoline and housing"
173,That’s why I support suspending the recent gas tax increase for a year andfully eliminating the grocery tax immediately
174,There’s bipartisan support for eliminating the grocery tax
175," Together, we willgive Virginians real relief"
176,We also need to give Virginians a real break on their personal income tax bydoubling the standard deduction
177, And providing the largest tax rebate inVirginia history
178,These tax cuts benefit the people who need it the most
179,"And represent the largest tax relief ever given to the people of Virginia $1,500this year for the typical Virginia family"
180,"But beyond the economic implications of this package, I believe we have aspecial obligation to a group of individuals that have served our country withdistinction our military veterans"
181,Those who risk life and limb for country and community don’t do it for thepay
182, They do it because service is in their blood
183,"The care and support of our veterans, have always transcended partisanpolitics"
184,That’s why I’m asking this General Assembly to act on something long talkedabout
185,"Let’s eliminate the tax on the first $40,000 in military retirement pay together"
186,Anyone who wears the uniform risks their life each day on the job
187," And thisincludes police officers, firefighters, EMTs, every first responder that keepsus safe"
188,We’re in a fractious era and no group of individuals is under greater scrutinytoday than our law enforcement
189,A culture of lawlessness has filled the void in Virginia with violent crime onthe rise
190,"In November, Police Officer Michael Chandler of the Big Stone Gap PoliceDepartment was violently gunned down by a vicious criminal"
191,Incidents like this are all too common today
192,We’ll never know the depth of his loss to his family but we grieve with themand pray for them
193,"In Virginia, we must stand with our law enforcement agencies"
194," And therefore,I’m asking you to fund our police to protect our communities"
195,Officer Michael Chandler’s widow --- Natasha Chandler is also a member oflaw enforcement
196," She’s a Wise County Deputy Sheriff who even after losingher husband, insisted on returning to serve"
197,She’s watching this afternoon
198,"Please join me in recognizing the sacrifice that her husband, Michael, madeon our behalf"
199,"The budget submitted to this General Assembly includes pay raises fortroopers, sheriffs’ deputies and corrections officers"
200,Those are strong first steps I know we all support
201,But we need to provide more funding for our police departments
202, And morefunding for training and equipment
203,"Together, we should dedicate $100 million in ARPA funds to a training andequipment grant program for law enforcement"
204, And provide capital fundingfor a new state police training facility
205,"Furthermore, I’m asking you to dedicate $26 million in state funding for policedepartments"
206, But only in localities that are increasing funding for their policedepartments
207,We’ll also fund community violence intervention by dedicating at least $5million to Operation Cease Fire
208,It’s time to take down the temperature around discussions of policing
209,The solution is constructive engagement and dialogue
210, Not inadequatefunding which creates more lawlessness
211,"And when it comes to lawlessness, I want to be crystal clear"
212,If we won’t tolerate it in communities across the commonwealth then wecertainly won’t tolerate it within a state agency
213,"On Saturday, I fired the entire parole board"
214,And I asked Attorney General Miyares to begin an investigation into whathappened there
215,"The violations of law and the Constitution, the unconscionable refusal tonotify families, of victims about pending decisions to release murderers, weresimply unacceptable"
216,We will not accept selective violations of our constitutional rights
217, We willprotect all of them
218,We don’t get to pick and choose the parts of the Constitution we want topreserve and protect
219,"In order for our government to work for the people, we must also reform theinstitutions of government that fail to serve the people"
220,I’ll admit I’ve never run a government agency
221, But I know something aboutrunning a business
222,And we’re going to bring business efficiency to government bureaucracy
223,That’s why I appointed a Commonwealth Chief Transformation Officer --- tooversee government transformation
224,"We will make government more responsive, more efficient, and moretransparent and we’ll start by fixing the Department of Motor Vehicles andthe Virginia Employment Commission"
225,"Furthermore, we will be innovative in leveraging federal transportation fundsto address the challenges of growth and gridlock"
226,"In Virginia, we are going to build roads, bridges, rail lines and utility lines"
227,We are going to be better prepared for weather events that strain ourhighways and the electric grid
228,And we will marshal our resources to make our infrastructure the mostreliable in the nation
229,"As I travel Virginia, I remain in awe of the raw natural beauty of ourCommonwealth"
230,"The mountains, waterways, beaches, parks, farm land, livestock, vineyards,and natural resources testify to our Creator’s artistry"
231,I deeply treasure the natural beauty of Virginia
232, And my administration willdedicate itself to protecting and promoting it as a core principle of ourservice
233,That’s why we will end the dumping of raw sewage in the James River onceand for all
234,I also support fully funding best management practices on our farms in orderto protect our soil and water from the Chesapeake Bay to the Jackson River
235,And we are going to see the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay to the finish line
236,Coastal resiliency is critical to me
237,And it’s critical to our nation because of our Port and military assets inHampton Roads
238,That’s why we’re going to create the Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority tobattle rising seas and make sure the federal government does its part too
239,Let me state our goal
240,Let’s work together in partnership
241, To build a government as virtuous as ourpeople
242, One that serves
243,You don’t have to look too far to find examples of that spirit among thepeople of Virginia
244,I met a veteran of our military on the campaign trail by the name of NatashaBarijon 
245,She’s an immigrant
246," And like so many first generation immigrants, she lovesthis country with a passion few can understand though certainly ourlieutenant governor can"
247,Natasha knows what life is like in other parts of the world
248,Which is why tears flowed down her face when she told me about her journeyto America her pride in serving in our military and the hopes and dreams shehas for her daughter to grow up in a better America
249,Natasha represents the best of America
250,She may not have been born here but she is every bit American as someonewho was
251, Because she has lived the ideals of this great land
252,Natasha is also watching today
253,Please join me in recognizing her service to our country and her dreams forher daughter
254,Virginia is home to heroes
255, Many living and many who lie in eternal rest
256,"I attended the funeral of one such hero last month, in Virginia Beach – theCommanding Officer of SEAL Team 8, Brian Bourgeois"
257,Brian could light up a room with his laugh and he could put his subordinatesat ease during the most tense moments
258,Translations  ▼He gave his life in service to freedom
259," And he left behind a wife, Megan, andfive children"
260, One of which – Barrett – led us in the pledge of allegiance onSaturday
261,What price would we in this room put on freedom?For some freedom is so precious they would offer everything in its defense
262,Those of us who live in the freedom they so valiantly protect must live livesworthy of their sacrifice
263, Set aside petty divisions
264, Set aside ego and self-advancement
265," And join together to make this Virginia we love better, stronger,freer"
266,"My friends in this esteemed legislature, I’m inspired to be with you thisafternoon"
267, And to be working with you to build a future of limitlessopportunity and strengthen the spirit of Virginia
268,"Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia"

45," We know the next severalweeks are going to be incredibly challenging across the country, and we’ll be focused on this issue"
46,"But for today, let’s focus on the future"
47,Because we have to learn to manage life with this virus and cannot let it derail us from addressingour most fundamental challenges: Our desperate need for more people in our communities andmore workers to ﬁll the tens of thousands of jobs available in Vermont today
48,"In January 2020, when the new virus was just a ﬂeeting mention on the nightly news, I stood beforeyou and shared my biggest concern: That for years our working-age population and the number ofkids in our schools had been shrinking unsustainably, creating deep economic inequity between thenorthwestern part of our state and everywhere else"
49,I reported at the time that only three counties had added workers while the other 11 had lost them
50,"Today, all 14 have lost workers, even Chittenden"
51," And Windsor, Windham, Caledonia, Bennington,Essex and Rutland are down 15% or more since their peak"
52," Statewide, we have seen our workforcedecrease by nearly 30,000 since 2010"
53,"It’s clear that while the pandemic didn’t create this problem, it has made it much, much worse"
54,"***The hardest part of addressing our workforce shortage is that it is so intertwined with other bigchallenges, from affordability and education to our economy and recovery"
55," Each problem makes theothers harder to solve, creating a vicious cycle that’s been difﬁcult to break"
56,"Speciﬁcally, I believe our high cost of living has contributed to a declining workforce and stuntedour growth"
57," As we lose Vermonters who cannot afford to live, do business, or even retire here, thatburden – from taxes and utility rates to healthcare and education costs – falls on fewer and fewer ofus, making life even less affordable"
58, With fewer working families comes fewer kids in our schools
59," But lower enrollment hasn’t meantlower costs and from district to district, kids are not offered the same opportunities, like foreignlanguages, AP courses, or electives"
60," And with fewer school offerings, it is hard to attract families,workers, and jobs to those communities"
61,"Fewer workers and fewer students mean our businesses struggle to ﬁll the jobs they need tosurvive, deepening the economic divide from region to region"

65,***But here’s the good news: This is the moment we’ve been waiting for and working towards
66,"We’ve been making headway on these issues for the last ﬁve years, putting ourselves in a positionto reverse our workforce trends, revitalize every county in our state, and secure the future we’veenvisioned:One where Vermonters can ﬁnd a good job, a good school, and an affordable home in each of our 14counties and 251 cities, towns, and villages"
67, Where kids in the smallest communities have as manyopportunities as kids in the largest
68, Where young families can afford to enjoy all our state has tooffer
69," And where a strong economy generates the tax revenue to easily serve all people, protect thevulnerable, and invest in the things we care about most"
70,I am more optimistic than I have ever been that this future is within our grasp
71," But we have got towork together, so we do not squander this once-in-a-life time opportunity to truly transform ourstate"
72,"Five years ago, I said, “when you are in a hole, stop digging"
73,"” My friends, today I am happy to report:We are out of that hole, and we are sitting on a pile of bricks, mortar, lumber, and steel"
74,"So, let’s grab hold, and start building"
75,*** Now we know this will not be easy
76, It is going to take all of us committing to this goal and pulling inthe same direction
77,And I want to acknowledge up front that I will not have all the answers
78, Many solutions will comefrom local communities and legislative committees
79,You can expect proposals on my end to be geared towards workforce
80," Because whether it is trainingand recruitment, childcare, tax policy, housing, healthcare, infrastructure, or climate change, wemust reverse our workforce trends"
81,"And just so we are clear, for any legislation to have my support, it cannot make this problem worse"

85,"***So, let’s start with the people already here and do more to connect them with great jobs"
86,"First, our internship, returnship, and apprenticeship programs have been incredibly successful, notonly giving workers job experience, but also building ties to local employers"
87," To improve on thiswork, the Department of Labor assists employers to ﬁll and manage internships statewide and we’llinvest more to help cover interns’ wages"
88,And let’s not forget about retired Vermonters who want to go back to work and have a lot to offer
89, Ilook forward to working with Representative Marcotte and the House Commerce Committee onthis issue and may others
90,"Next, let’s put a greater focus on trades training"
91, And here’s why:We all know we need more nurses and healthcare workers
92," And as I previewed with SenatorSanders and Senator Balint earlier this week, I will propose investments in this area"
93," But if we don’thave enough CDL drivers, mechanics and technicians, hospital staff won’t get to work; there will beissues getting the life-saving equipment and supplies we need; and we will see fewer EMTs availableto get patients to emergency rooms"
94," If we don’t have enough carpenters, plumbers and electricians,or heating, ventilation, air handling and refrigeration techs, there are fewer to construct andmaintain the facilities in our healthcare system or build homes for the workers we are trying toattract"
95,"If we make smart changes to current policy, we can open the door to Career and TechnicalEducation, giving kids multiple paths to a lucrative career and ﬁlling these crucial jobs"
96,"But more importantly, we need to do more to encourage students to pursue these programs"
97," And Ican say from my own personal experience, it is not easy to choose the CTE track, even when it isyour passion"
98,"For far too long, we have not done enough to point students toward these great opportunities tobuild a real future for themselves"
99, It is time we end the stigma around CTE
100," Because the fact is,many of the smartest, most successful people I know are in the trades"

104,"***Our strategy to grow the workforce cannot just be about training, it must be about meeting theneeds of families"
105," That’s why my workforce proposals also include things like housing, affordability,and jobs"
106,"Twice over the last ﬁve years, we have passed the largest investments in housing in the state’shistory"
107,"Last year, we focused heavily on permanent housing for homeless Vermonters"
108," As a result, we havebuilt about 800 new affordable units with another 800 under development"
109," And we have helpedover 1,300 struggling families transition out of homelessness, giving them the dignity and securityof permanent homes to regain their independence"
110,"And to help with heating costs and reduce emissions, we are working to deploy the $20 million inweatherization funds passed last year"
111,"This is important but it is not enough, and it does not get at the heart of our problem: the lack ofdecent, affordable homes for middle income families"
112,"Without it, workers we have can’t afford to move up and the workers we want can’t afford to movein"
113,We must recognize housing policy is workforce policy
114," If you will work with me in budgetadjustment to allocate $80 million more, we can show we are fully committed to this cause"
115," And inthe budget I will present in two weeks, you can expect to see another $100 million – because it’stime get serious about putting the beneﬁts of a good home and a good investment within the reachof every Vermonter"
116,***Housing is not the only area that remains unaffordable
117, Our ﬁscal discipline over the last ﬁve years– including multiple budgets that did not raise taxes or fees – narrowed the gap between theincreasing costs of state government and growth in paychecks
118," But the fact is, Vermont is still ranked near the top of the list when it comes to tax burden and costhttps://governor"

121," So, we should do our part to keep the costs of government policies from rising faster thanpeoples’ wages"
122," Because when these costs rise faster, we are pushing people down the economicladder"
123," But when take-home pay is growing faster than these costs, we are helping people move up"
124,"So, I will put forward a balanced and progressive tax relief package with a focus on those who needit, like retirees, middle income families and young workers"
125,We all want to see Vermonters take home more in their paychecks and for every family to havesome breathing room once their bills are paid
126," If we work together, we can make this happen thissession"
127," ***We know we need more workers, and that also means we need to keep the good jobs we have andadd more of them"
128,"That is why I will propose expanding the Capital Investment Grant program, which we created with$10 million last year, but we received applications for six times that amount"
129," This program is helpingemployers, like childcare and senior centers, museums, theaters and agricultural businesses,enhance their facilities and keep good jobs and services here – so let’s do more"
130,We are also continuing our work to attract new businesses from Canada with the help of our newbusiness recruitment ofﬁce in Montreal
131,"And let’s also help our most cutting-edge employers, like Northern Reliability and BetaTechnologies, become global leaders to grow our tech and climate sectors right here in Vermont"
132,"***As I have said many times, if we build the strongest Cradle to Career education system in thecountry, it will be one of the best economic development tools we could ask for"
133,And this means looking beyond a preK-12 system
134,We have worked together to increase the State’s investment in childcare by over 30% since I tookofﬁce
135," To build on that, I will propose changes to our Childcare Financial Assistance program toincrease access to quality care and learning"

139," Last year we joined Senator Sanders, schools and privatepartners to take some big leaps forward"
140," Through our Summer Matters initiative, we added 30,000more summer camp slots and about 240 more weeks of programming"
141," And we will do it againbecause we should be offering these opportunities to young Vermonters, year-round"
142,"***This initiative came at a time when our kids desperately needed to reconnect with friends, getoutside and just have fun"
143,"Because we must acknowledge that many of the difﬁcult decisions we made to keep people safebefore vaccines, while necessary at the time, had negative effects"
144, These are the real-lifeconsequences we must consider when thinking about returning to restrictive pandemic measures
145,"Just look at our hospitals, where many patients are sicker and getting admitted because of deferredcare"
146," Or our mental health system, where demand for crisis services has never been higher"
147,"And when it comes to our kids, who lost out on months of full in-person instruction, not to mentionmusic, drama, sports, ﬁeld trips, dances and all those normal interactions we took for granted, thispandemic has taken a signiﬁcant toll"
148,"The strain was far too much for some, sending them to the ER for mental health needs"
149," And while itwas less severe for others, the grief was still felt"
150,"Last spring, I heard directly from students about the impact of hybrid learning"
151," A 13-year-old fromFair Haven put it best: She said, “Not being able to enjoy school and socialize with friends has madea lot of us feel lonely and down"
152,” And she asked me to “bring back some enjoyable activities sostudents will look forward to going to school
153,"”From academics to extra curriculars, we have a lot of ground to make up"
154," So, the Agency ofEducation, Department of Mental Health and schools are putting $285 million in recovery dollarsto work to address social, emotional and educational gaps"
155,"I know teachers, parents, school nurses and administrators are working harder than ever to makeup for these losses, all while dealing with high case counts"
156, I thank every single one of them
157," I knowit is not easy, but it is so much better for students to be back in school"

162,"Our mental health system is facing serious stress and it is not uncommon for emergencydepartments to have many people in mental health crisis, as they await treatment"
163, Which is why wewill continue to increase the number of mental health beds throughout the state
164,"And I’ll ask you to expand our mobile crisis pilot and suicide prevention model to make sure whenour friends and family, neighbors and co-workers need us most, we have the tools to help"
165,"And while we did our best to support those struggling with addiction during the pandemic, the datais clear: It was not enough"
166," So, my budget will expand prevention, treatment and recovery efforts"
167,Supporting those dealing with substance misuse and addiction has been a priority and acommitment we have all shared for nearly a decade
168," No matter what other challenges come ourway, we cannot weaken our efforts to reduce the number of Vermonters struggling with drugs andalcohol, the number of families it touches, and the lives it claims"
169,"***This work not only keeps people healthier, but it also makes communities safer"
170,"As we modernize law enforcement policy, we cannot forget that police and other ﬁrst respondersare essential to public safety"
171, And this is another area where we have a signiﬁcant labor shortage
172,The work we are doing to continuously improve fair and impartial policing is necessary andimportant
173, And much of it is being led by our state and local ofﬁcers themselves

180,This is exactly why the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) investments we made last year were soimportant

182, We are also working to help Montgomery with its plans for a similar projectthat will also bring jobs and housing
183," And with our investments in broadband, we will bring ﬁber topeople, who for far too long, have had little or no access to this service"
184," But only a portion of the $1billion proposal I presented was funded, so this year we will ask for the rest of it"
185,Just making the investments is not enough because it remains difﬁcult and expensive to build herein Vermont
186," So, let’s continue expanding tax credits for our downtowns"
187," And let’s add more tools torevitalize vacant, and once vibrant properties, including some of our shuttered campuses like GreenMountain College in Poultney and old industrial sites like Jones & Lamson in Springﬁeld"
188,There are many ways to strengthen our communities and we ﬁnally have the funds to do this work
189,But we must ensure our regulatory system does not become the bottleneck that holds us back

21,  I figured the least Icould do as your Governor was brave a snow storm to deliver the State of the State Address
22," One year ago, I delivered a speech a few miles from here in the Orr Building at the StateFairgrounds as members of our Illinois National Guard readied the facility to serve as a massvaccination site"
23,"  Like all of you, I had hoped that that was the beginning of the end of one of themost challenging times our state and our nation has ever lived through"
24, But it wasn't the end
25,"  We continue even now to battle an invisible enemy that has challenged allour institutions and forced every single Illinoisan to confront deeply held convictions about family,work, education, healthcare, science and our collective responsibility to one another"
26, It would be the most human of tendencies to obsess during this time over one question: Why?  Whyare we going through this?  Why did it start
27,
28,
29,"why won't it end?  Why is this the slice of history weare being asked to carry? The answers to those questions remain elusive - and we cannot allow their pursuit to distract usfrom another more essential question: How will we distinguish ourselves and how will historyremember us during this time? According to legend, the famed cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead once delivered a lecture toher students that started with this question to her class: ""What was the earliest sign of humancivilization?"" The answers her students provided are what you might predict: tools, pots, weapons, iron,agriculture"
30, But Mead shook her head no to all these answers and instead held up a healed femur - a leg bonethat had broken and mended
31,"  She explained that this healing was the first sign of true civilizationbecause it meant someone had looked after this person - given them food, shelter and rest at greatpersonal sacrifice"
32,  Mead's argument was that true human civilization arrived when our ancestorschose to look out for one another despite personal risk or inconvenience
33, The question of what we owe our fellow humans has been front and center in my mind over the lastseveral years - but most especially the last 12 months
34,  And I keep returning to Margaret Mead'ssimple lesson - that the measure of any society is how willing we are to care for those who need us
35,The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with a challenge the likes of which we have not seen ingenerations
36,  It has brought families to their breaking points - with parents especially struggling every day to tryand make the right decisions for their children as well as their own parents and grandparents
37, COVID has forced a true reckoning about what it means to work and what it means to live - nohkidfjbhldidEkifiiddimatter what kind of job you are holding down
38,  Every worker in every profession is demanding arethinking right now of the sacrifices they are being asked to make
39, Every working parent isnavigating how to hold Zoom calls with a toddler screaming in the background or facing theimpossible choice between going to their hourly job or staying home with a sick child
40,   And I talk to so many entrepreneurs who want to do right by their workers — at the same time theyhave to keep up with their competitors in order to survive
41,  But no one in our state has born a greater burden in the last twelve months than the nurses anddoctors and first responders who have had no respite from the unrelenting agony of the mostbrutal parts of the global pandemic
42, TO THE ILLINOIS MEDICAL COMMUNITY: I know that every career in healthcare begins withsomeone who wants to help sick people get well
43,"  I know that during the months and years youpracticed and trained for the job you hold now, you had to come to terms with the idea that youcouldn't save everyone - that some people would be too sick, some cases too hard to solve"
44,   I know you learned to cope with that inevitability by discovering the balance between joy and grief
45, I know that underneath that balance you felt the world owed you a promise to never let one side ofthat scale get too overwhelming
46,   And I know that you feel like that promise has been broken - that too much grief has robbed theprofession you have devoted your life to of all its joy
47,  I know that as you have watched yourhospitals fill with patients once again these last two months - that there is a small but persistentvoice inside of you asking you how much more you can take
48, I wish I could lift this burden from you
49,  I wish it with all my heart
50,"   But in the absence of the ability to do that - I feel it important to stand here, in the most visiblepublic forum I can think of, and say: I see you"
51,  Our entire state sees you
52,"  And while we can't takeaway your burden, we can directly acknowledge it and assist you in carrying some of it"
53,  And asGovernor I can offer you my most deep and heartfelt thanks on behalf of a grateful state
54,One thing we can all do right now is continue rising to the challenge of combatting the pandemichead on
55, And we are
56,  A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state
57," Ourstate has led with equity, with the highest regional vaccination rates for our Black and Brownresidents"
58, We are the leader in vaccinating kids 5 to 17 years old
59," We've held over 7,350 mobilevaccination clinics at churches, senior centers, schools, day camps, and YMCAs to make gettingthe vaccine easier for every Illinoisan who wants it"
60,"  The battle to keep people safe from the virus isn't over, though we are more experienced atmanaging through it"
61," When the surge came last fall, we put our masks back on - and it helped keepourhospitalsfrombeingoverrunToprotectthemostvulnerablepeopleinourstate'scareIour hospitals from being overrun"
62," To protect the most vulnerable people in our states care, Irequired vaccinations at state-run congregate care facilities, including our veterans' homes andhomes for people with developmental disabilities"
63, Our schools have remained safe and open
64,"  Of the more than 850 public school districts in ourstate, fewer than a dozen have had to take an adaptive pause recently because of COVID-19"
65,"That's because we have three tools that we know work: masks, testing and vaccines"
66,"  And I havenot hesitated to use these tools and make them available to schools so they can maintain in-personlearning for Illinois' children while protecting parents, teachers, and staff"
67,"  In fact, we set thenational standard for how to safely keep kids in schools when the CDC adopted our Illinois ""test-to-stay"" model"
68," The virus has remained a threat for far longer than any of us would like, but we continue to findways to live our lives AND protect the vulnerable all at the same time"
69,The pandemic recession has taken an enormous financial toll on workers and businesses
70, Government must continue to do everything possible to help people recover
71,"  With all our effortsover the last two years — city, county, state, federal — we're seeing signs of progress every singleday"
72,  Our investments in working families and small businesses are paying off
73," Since the bottom of the pandemic recession in April of 2020, we have added 600,000 jobs andgrown the overall state GDP beyond pre-pandemic levels"
74, Illinois job growth now outpaces thenational job growth
75," Wages have increased for working class families, and jobs are available forworkers of nearly every skill"
76, Workers have bargaining power like never before
77, And businesseshave applied ingenuity and creativity to rebuild and grow and are making Illinois one of the bestplaces to do business in the country
78, Our recovery is happening because our people have an unmatched work ethic and our employersan incredible commitment to workers and the communities they serve
79,  It's also happening becausewe've focused on providing as much stability as possible for small businesses and workers andfamilies here in Illinois
80, To succeed we've had to acknowledge that working parents need childcare
81," In the early months ofthe pandemic, we launched a childcare support program that is now nationally recognized —delivering relief grants to provide a safe work environment for caregivers, and allowing childcareproviders to stay afloat during the worst of this global health crisis"
82,  We've been awarding retentionbonuses to Illinois' childcare workers
83, We're providing out-of-work parents with three months oflow-cost or free childcare so they can look for a job without worrying about their kids
84," Then we partnered with the General Assembly to award nearly $1 billion in grants to more than12,000 small businesses - covering every sector of the Illinois economy, especially those that wereleft out of the federal PPP program"
85,"  Because of it, tens of thousands of jobs in every part of ourstate were saved"
86, WealsoneededtokeepstrugglingfamiliesfrombeingforcedoutoftheirhomesbythepandemicWe also needed to keep struggling families from being forced out of their homes by the pandemicrecession
87," So with the help of Representative Delia Ramirez and Senator Omar Aquino, the IllinoisHousing Development Authority went to work, providing some of the fastest relief for landlords andtenants among all the states"
88,"  More than $1 billion has kept renters and homeowners from losingtheir housing, with hundreds of millions more to support them in the first half of 2022"
89,"  Aprohibition on COVID-related evictions, utility shutoffs, and vehicle repossessions protected thosesuffering pandemic-related hardships"
90," Throughout this deadly pandemic, I've governed with a consistent philosophy: protect the mostvulnerable, offer simple and straightforward help through the hard times, and make Illinois anexample for the rest of the country for how to manage through the crisis"
91," Because of the amazing residents of this state, we've been able to do that"
92," Within weeks of being sworn in as governor in 2019, I appeared in the front of the GeneralAssembly for the very first time with a dire report on the state of the state's finances and anoverview of the true fiscal wreckage left for us to clean up"
93,  Back then we had a $3
94,2 billion deficit
95, We had $7
96,9 billion owed in unpaid bills
97,  The state had doled out over $1
98,2 billion in late paymentpenalties
99,"  We had suffered an astonishing eight credit rating downgrades in the years 2015 to2017, and our credit hovered at just one notch above junk status"
100,   I made a promise that day
101," I said: ""Budgeting will not be done any more by taking the state hostage,or by court orders, consent decrees and continuing appropriations but instead by debate andcompromise and a return to regular order"
102, We will work together earnestly to solve the state'sproblems
103," We will disagree at times on important things, but the work we all came here to do willget done"
104,""" I believe that if we are ever going to fix what is broken in the American political system, it startswith politicians keeping their word"
105,   So let me offer an update on the promise of fiscal responsibility I made to you three years ago
106," After decades of credit downgrades, by the end of my second full fiscal year in office, Illinoisreceived two credit upgrades - the first upgrades the state has received in over 20 years"
107,"  Themassive bill backlog that contained bills past due for as long as 500 days, now contains onlyunpaid General Funds bills averaging 15 days old"
108, And that $3
109,2 billion structural deficit? Well today I'm pleased to announce Illinois will end thisfiscal year with a $1
110,"7 billion surplus, the first of its kind in more than 25 years"
111," Now, I know that the same tired old characters who are always so desperate to bad-mouth Illinoiswill falsely attribute our fiscal success to the federal American Rescue Plan Act"
112,"  As usual, they'rewrong"
113, LhdihfbdlldiihhLet me set the record straight for you — our state budget surpluses would exist even without themoney we received from the federal government
114,"  Painstaking work has been done in coordinationwith the General Assembly and Comptroller Susana Mendoza over the last 3 years to diligently andmeticulously reverse the irresponsible decisions of the past and ensure that responsible budgetingwould become the rule, not the exception"
115,"  What a self-indulgent position the cynics take, always opposing what's in the best interest of thepeople of Illinois if they think it will advance their own political standing"
116," It's a curious position - butthen again, there have long been people in Illinois state politics who have cared more aboutpromoting their own propaganda than they do about what's best for your pocketbooks"
117,"  During thisbudget cycle especially, seats at the grown-up table will be off limits to those who aren't working inthe public's best interests"
118," Back in 2019, I promised you that we would not allow political posturing by those people to againtake the state's finances hostage"
119, I ran for Governor to move beyond that
120,  And we have
121,"  If youdon't believe me, take it from the credit rating agency S&P"
122,"  In their announcement last year ofIllinois's credit upgrade they said: ""The political gridlock that stymied governance a few fiscal yearsago has dissipated"
123,""" Look, the actual work of managing Illinois' state finances is decidedly unglamorous"
124,"  It is hours ofhammering away at calcified problems of the past, persistently reducing liabilities on our state'sbalance sheet, finding and implementing efficiencies and savings, upgrading systems that trackexpenditures, and asking every government employee to be a partner in smart budgeting"
125,"  It's notpartisan work, it's not political work"
126,
127,
128,it's just hard work
129,"  It requires resisting the temptation to letpolitical expediency take over our budget process, and it demands discipline and a commitment todo what's right"
130, And that is what my administration and a majority of the General Assembly have been committed todoing — no matter how difficult the circumstances or how unprecedented the times
131,   So let's talk about good governance and what fiscal responsibility looks like
132,  During those first few terrible months of the COVID crisis - when it was unclear whether the bottomwould completely fall out of state revenues — we borrowed $3
133,2 billion from the federalgovernment so we wouldn't wonder if the state could meet the needs of people who weresuffering
134,  Not a chance I was going to allow an interruption of vital services by our hospitals or letour schools close for lack of PPE
135,"  And as soon as our state revenues rebounded, paying down ourborrowing was among my highest priorities"
136," We paid our debt back nearly 2 years early, savingtaxpayers $82 million in interest costs"
137, Then there were the short-term borrowings that date back to the budget crisis five years ago
138," Thebill backlog, that at its height reached nearly $17 billion, and the $1"
139,"5 billion borrowed from thestate treasury, have now been paid down"
140, IbliiidbI believe in paying our debts
141,"  Each year I've served as Governor, our state has met its pension payment obligations"
142," But when weare able, I think we ought to do more than just pay the minimum"
143, That's why I propose making notonly our minimum pension payment this year but also an additional half a billion dollars
144," If approved by the General Assembly, this will be the first time since the beginning of 1994 pensionfunding ramp that we will reduce our pension debt by more than our required contribution"
145, I amasking Democrats and Republicans to work together with me to get this done because it will savetaxpayers $1
146,8 billion in interest payments over the coming years
147," For longer than I can remember, the pension naysayers have told us we should ignore theconstitution and the protections it provides and instead break our promises to retirees"
148, I won't dothat
149," Instead we are tackling our pension problem with responsible pension investment decisions,solid investment returns, and expansion of the pension buyout program"
150," As a result, pensionliabilities are down, and pension assets are up"
151," There's more work to do, but pension payments asa percentage of our budget have finally flattened and are projected to decline"
152, Great news forpensioners and taxpayers alike
153,"  For years, Illinois has been without any financial cushion in the event of a downturn, and 22 monthsago we experienced how debilitating that could be"
154," Now that we've paid down our bill backlog andconsistently balanced the budget, it's time to begin restoring our state's long neglected BudgetStabilization Fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund"
155, Right now the average state can run for 29days on its Rainy Day Fund
156," In Illinois, we can run for 15 minutes"
157,  I'm proposing that we set aside$600 million for the fund this year plus another $279 million next year
158," The past few years haveshown us that rainy days do actually arrive, and it's time to begin rebuilding protections from futurefiscal calamities"
159," At the beginning of my term, I tasked Illinois Central Management Services with taking acomprehensive look at ALL real estate holdings that Illinois has accumulated over the years - andto make an honest effort to eliminate the waste and inefficiency that had previously beenoverlooked"
160," As a result of their work, I made the decision to consolidate multiple long term leases in downtownChicago - saving taxpayers an average of approximately $20 million a year, for the next 30 years"
161,  Then there's the James R
162," Thompson Center, the least efficient building owned by the state"
163,  Fortwenty years governors have talked about selling the building — one even pretended to sell it in twoof his budget proposals
164,  I decided I would just get to work and actually sell it in real life
165,  A privatebuyer now has offered to purchase it by assuming several hundred million dollars in liabilities andpaying the state $70 million in cash
166,"  Altogether, the net savings for state taxpayers approachesthree quarters of a billion dollars — and the city of Chicago will get a brand-new, revenue-producing, renovated property in the heart of downtown"
167," OllihhiliillhddIlliiffibOverall, with this real estate restructuring we will have reduced Illinois government office space byover 640,000 square feet by 2024 and lowered the cost of leasing Chicago office space from $41 asquare foot to just $20 a square foot"
168," This is an example of how we're bringing operational improvements to state government to reducewaste, inefficiency, and liabilities"
169,  Here's another example of past mismanagement we're repairing
170, College Illinois was a programstarted in the 1990's to help parents pay for college for their children
171,  The idea seemed simple -Illinois residents could purchase college tuition at current rates and that money would be investedand grow to cover the eventual costs of their children's college education
172,"  Over 70,000 Illinoisfamilies took advantage of this opportunity"
173," But 25 years later, the program was underfunded bynearly 30%, leaving parents holding the bag for a promise unfulfilled by state government"
174,  That'snot right
175,  So my budget proposes to pay off that unfunded state liability in full
176," Parents will sleepbetter at night, and it saves an additional $75 million dollars in future taxpayer liabilities"
177," Responsible fiscal management is yielding substantial savings, unburdening our state from theanchor that has weighed us down for far too long"
178," So, as we move on to tackle the questions of what vital current priorities our government shouldfund, know that we start from a place where our bills are paid, our most pressing short-term debtsare nearly gone and our most critical long term financial liabilities are in the best fiscal shape theyhave been in since the turn of the century"
179," The proposed 2023 budget I have submitted today includes substantial increases in the highestyielding investments we can make: early childhood, K-12 and higher education"
180," Notably, there is a$350 million increase for the K-12 Evidence Based Funding Formula, driving critical resources toour state's most underfunded schools"
181," I have also increased early childhood education by $54million, which together with the $200 million investment in upskilling our early childhood workforcewill go a long way toward meeting our goal of making Illinois the best state in the nation to raiseyoung children"
182," In years past, higher education had become an afterthought in our state budgets"
183," Because of thedisinvestment, post-secondary education became more and more expensive for students and theirfamilies"
184," That's why at the beginning of my term I pledged to do three things to address thisproblem: Increase MAP scholarships by $200 million, get more Pell Grants and low cost federalloans for Illinois students, and increase direct support for institutions of higher learning"
185," With thisFY23 budget proposal, we will have achieved all three during my first term in office, withsubstantial increases in MAP grants, community college and university operational support, and jobtraining investments"
186,"  The cost of pursuing higher education in Illinois is finally going down, andwe're opening the door to a brighter future for more Illinoisans"
187, I'm also asking the General Assembly to broaden the allowable uses of MAP scholarships for careertraining programs in critical industries like healthcare
188," This small change will open more trainingddiiifhdfIlliidiilllkddiand education opportunities for thousands of Illinoisans, and it will put people to work addressingthe critical healthcare workforce shortage"
189, Our healthcare institutions and healthcare workers need help
190, That's why this proposed budgetcreates the Pipeline for the Advancement of the Healthcare Workforce — or PATH — program
191, Thegoal is to model this program after the highly successful Workforce Equity Initiative championed byState Representative Jehan Gordon-Booth
192, The PATH program will invest $25 million in ourcommunity colleges to remove barriers for recruitment and training of new front-line healthcareworkers
193,  My budget also proposes to invest new resources in nursing scholarships and loanforgiveness programs
194,"   And finally, I'm proposing to eliminate licensure fees for 470,000 nurses, physicians, pharmacists,pharmacy technicians, respiratory care workers, social workers and others in the coming fiscalyear"
195, Let's recognize the burden our healthcare workers have borne and give them a much-neededreprieve
196, Aggressively protecting and supporting vulnerable children and families is a high priority for us all
197," Since coming into office, I've substantially increased the budget at the Department of Children andFamily Services to reverse the damage of the prior administration, bringing on hundreds of newstaff, retraining every DCFS worker and manager, allowing our private partners to increase wages,and helping them make a dent in the hundreds of shelter beds lost under the prior administration"
198,"This year, as the agency continues to battle pandemic-era worker shortages and increased case-load, I propose we add another $250 million to hire more child welfare workers, and increase thenumber of safe and supportive settings available to care for vulnerable children"
199," Nobody has escaped the isolation, burn out, and trauma of the past two years"
200," Now more thanever, it's important to invest in behavioral health"
201, That's why I will be appointing a Chief BehavioralHealth Officer to oversee and coordinate behavioral health services directly with the Governor'sOffice
202," Behavioral health is an area where Representative Deb Conroy is a real leader, and withpartners across the rotunda like Senators Sara Feigenholtz and Laura Fine, I'm confident the ChiefBehavioral Health Officer will succeed in streamlining and coordinating these services across stateagencies"
203, And we can't talk about health in this state without recognizing the tremendous leadership of Lt
204,Governor Stratton to expand Alzheimer's awareness and bring the world closer to eradicating thisheart-breaking disease
205," Over the summer, we made Illinois the first state in the nation to requireregular Alzheimer's diagnosis training for all licensed, adult-serving healthcare professionals"
206,"Building on that progress, today I'm proposing an expansion of Illinois' Alzheimer's outreach,research, care and support"
207," With the state and the nation experiencing a rise in violent crime, addressing public safety requiresmajor investments"
208, But too often those elected officials yelling the loudest about public safetyconcerns are also those voting to defund government budgets
209,"  Crime is a complex and multi-faceted problem to tackle, and it's cynical and counter-productive to simply shout ""Lock them up""hilidifhldhiihfilwhile providing fewer resources to the people and programs that prevent crime in the first place"
210, A truly effective approach to tackling crime involves both short term and long-term investmentsand a commitment to see those investments through
211,"  Let's start with this: If we want to reduce crime, we have to solve crimes"
212, That's why I reestablishedthe Division of Criminal Investigations when I first took office
213," It's why we are building a new, state-of-the-art crime lab near Joliet and opening another in Decatur"
214, My proposed budget continues toincrease the number of Illinois State Police forensic scientists and evidence technicians
215, And we'realready succeeding in one important arena — we've substantially reduced the backlog of DNA andother analyses on evidence in sexual assault cases
216," As a result, victims and survivors will finally getthe justice they deserve"
217," On the front lines, I've been growing our state police every year since I took office, but they needeven more support"
218," Under my predecessor their ranks had been severely depleted to only 1,625troopers, down 31% from its peak"
219, So every year I've worked with the majority in the GeneralAssembly to rebuild the ISP
220," On top of the hundreds of sworn officers we've hired already, the FY23budget provides resources to add largest number of state police cadets in any single year"
221, Victims and witnesses need to feel safe if they're going to be willing to come forward and identifyviolent criminals
222," Nearly a decade ago, Speaker Welch and Senator Van Pelt led the creation of theGang Crime Witness Protection Program"
223,  It was intended to provide resources to prosecutors andthe Attorney General to pay for the protection of victims and witnesses who are assisting in theprosecution of gang violence perpetrators
224," Disappointingly, the program was never funded"
225, TodayI'm proposing we immediately authorize a $20 million investment in it
226,"  If we want people to speakup without fear of intimidation, we need to give law enforcement the resources they need toprotect victims and witnesses that want to do the right thing"
227," To prevent violent crime and reduce the direct burden on police, Illinois is awarding grants toorganizations that implement data-driven, community-driven violence prevention efforts"
228,  Thisbudget proposal advances our $250 million multi-year investment in crime prevention in theReimagine Public Safety Act
229,"  From the time I became Governor until this current fiscal year, wemore than doubled the funding for violence interruption, diversion, and youth employmentprograms to $517 million"
230, I'm proposing we increase that appropriation to $832 million
231," And as anadditional relief for police departments, this budget provides greater funding for police bodycameras"
232," Smart investments in front line personnel, in protecting witnesses, in community renewal, in mentalhealth, in economic opportunities, and in solving crimes are the best ways to reduce violence onour streets"
233, The 2023 budget continues providing direct grants for thousands more small businessessupporting their recovery
234, We're extending the Rebuild Downtowns and Main Streets program torevitalize community business districts across Illinois
235," On top of that, I propose suspending licenseffh23000dbbiiddiillifidhdfees for more than 23,000 restaurants and bars, bringing some additional relief to an industry hardhit by the pandemic"
236," Along with this small business support, I am calling on the General Assembly to renew theEconomic Development for a Growing Economy, or EDGE, Tax Credit Program which is set to expirein June"
237, EDGE is one of our most effective tools to grow and attract jobs
238,"   Right now, everyone is feeling the crunch of rising prices for goods and services"
239,  The higher costof even basic necessities is making it harder to make ends meet
240," Whether it's supply chaininterruptions or increasing oil prices, inflation is squeezing Illinois families"
241, Government ought to domore to ease the pain and put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Illinoisans
242, Ourbudget success gives us the opportunity to do just that
243," Therefore, today I am proposing the Illinois Family Relief Plan — to provide immediate assistance tohelp families fight inflation"
244," First, let's freeze the gas tax for the coming fiscal year"
245,"  Back in 2019, working with the GeneralAssembly, we passed a historic bipartisan infrastructure improvement plan"
246,"  Since then, countlessroads and bridges across the state have been repaired and improved to the benefit of localcommunities and businesses, and the federal infrastructure bill passed last year in Congress hasprovided additional funding"
247,"  Because the Illinois Department of Transportation has been efficientlycompleting projects on time and on budget, it has collected enough infrastructure dollars alreadyto allow us to freeze the gas tax for a year without affecting any of our road projects"
248, It will bringimmediate relief at the gas pump and still allow us to upgrade our infrastructure
249, Another place where families are getting hit hard by rising costs is at the grocery store
250,"  Access toaffordable food is fundamental to the American promise, but with the price of milk and eggs andbread going up, pocketbooks are being pinched"
251,"  We can afford to suspend the state tax ongroceries in the coming year, and have the state make up any lost revenue to local governments, sowe can bring some relief to families at the check-out counter"
252," Finally, local property taxes have long been an unsustainable burden for homeowners acrossIllinois"
253," Local governments, who impose property taxes, have received an unprecedented influx ofcash from the federal government in the last year, and an additional $1"
254,1 billion in annual supportdue to actions taken by the state
255, It's time for every local taxing district to take a long hard look atreducing the burden of high property taxes they impose on their local residents
256,"  At the state level, we can also take action"
257, I propose immediate property tax relief funded by thestate surplus
258,"  If we double the property tax deduction for Illinois homeowners, we can bring reliefto nearly 2 million Illinois taxpayers"
259," The Family Relief Plan can't solve all the challenges of global inflation, but we can do our part toalleviate some pressure on working families"

261,  I'm proud to say this proposed fiscal year 2023 budget plan does just that
262," With all the challenges we have overcome, with all the work it took to get here, with all the thingswe may face in the future - here's one thing I know for sure: Illinois is the best place to live in theentire country"
263," Our history is more interesting, our food more flavorful, our businesses more innovative, ourworkers more industrious, our schools more distinguished, our culture more illuminating and ourpeople more diverse and intelligent and creative than any other state in this great wide country ofours"
264," Contrary to those folks who spend their time orbiting Illinois politics just spelunking for misery, ourstate has a lot to be proud of"
265," We are modernizing our roads, our bridges, our schools and our broadband"
266," Thanks to RebuildIllinois, we've repaired over 3,300 miles of roads and 320 bridges in just the last two and a halfyears"
267, We now have the number one ranked infrastructure in the country
268," We have become a national leader in addressing climate change, even being recognized on theworld stage at the United Nations climate conference in Scotland last year, when Illinois becamethe first Midwest state to require 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045"
269," We acted swiftly and boldly last fall to reap the potential financial benefits of the new energyeconomy by passing the REV Act, providing attractive incentives for electric car manufacturers toset up shop in Illinois and bring new jobs to our communities"
270,"  We have also made it less expensivefor consumers to buy and drive an electric vehicle by offering $4,000 rebates to consumers andincentivizing the buildout of charging stations statewide"
271," At a time when people need reliable healthcare more than they ever have before, we provided $3"
272,8billion to hospitals serving Medicaid patients to increase access in underserved communities
273,  Wemade Illinois among the first states in the nation to require that insurers cover substance useprograms and mental health treatment
274, We made pandemic-era telehealth access permanent
275, Wecapped out-of-pocket insulin costs
276,  And we made it harder for insurance companies todiscriminate against those seeking fertility treatments
277," And at a time when politicians in some places have dipped their toes into the waters of sedition, orpulled chairs up for the ghosts of Jim Crow, or spurned the fires of educational curiosity in favor ofbook banning, or are telling women you have to take your reproductive health choices back to the1950's"
278,
279,
280,at a time when some would question the very foundations of science and medicine
281,
282,
283,at atime when some would condemn simple acts of courtesy and kindness like wearing a mask so thatfewer people die
284,
285,
286, THIS government in THIS state said
287,
288,
289,Not Here
290," In Illinois, our elections are protected because we're not scared of more people voting"
291," In Illinois, we care about expanding the freedoms and opportunities for our Black and brownresidents"
292," In Illinois, we built a firewall around the freedoms of every woman in this state, protecting the rightto choose in our laws and prohibiting the Supreme Court from taking it away"
293," In Illinois, we believe all workers deserve a real living wage and the right to organize"
294," In Illinois, we are not afraid of our history"
295,
296,
297,"after all, this country's past, some of its lowest and itshighest moments, runs straight through this state Capitol"
298," Abraham Lincoln, who once stood onthis very spot under this dome, once said: ""We cannot escape history"

300,""" In Illinois, we believe that the best thing we can do in difficult times is look out for one another"
301,  Leadership in times like these does not dance idly wherever the wind might blow
302,  Leadership intimes like these means having the courage to stand on deck while the waves crash around you andyou keep the ship pointing toward home
303, The din of a crisis is when a carnival barker's shout becomes a whisper soft enough to find the earsof the sick or worried or grieving or scared
304,
305,
306,"and the poison they worm into the hearts of thevulnerable is that it's ""those people"" "
307,
308,
309,"the ones who live in that city, the ones who worship at thataltar, the ones who were born in that place"
310,
311,
312,who are responsible for the hard times
313,   It's a playbook as old as the play
314,  And it's that kind of thinking I am asking you to reject in thismoment
315, I KNOW how hard everything feels right now
316,  I know that for the last two years it seems like wehave all been reaching for the shadow of a former life
317," You've been asked to sacrifice more than is fair, and we are all worried our hearts have forgottenhow to find hope "
318,
319,
320,but I am here to tell you that they haven't
321, I know that — because Illinois reminds me every single day of her kindness and her hope
322,"  I see it intired smiles, in tidy laughs, in the faces of parents protecting their children and in childrenprotecting their parents"
323,"  I glimpse it in the eyes that peek out over masks nodding at me quietly, orpulling me aside to tell me about a food kitchen they're trying to help or a blood drive they're tryingto publicize or a family they're trying to lift up"
324, I told you when I was elected that I would be a relentless optimist for this wonderful place that wecall home
325,  I didn't tell you I would be an optimist only if times weren't hard
326,  I didn't tell you I wouldbiilifhhllbe an optimist only if the challenges were easy
327, I didn't tell you that there was a limit to the hope I could find for this state
328,  Because there's not
329, Illinois has never let me down
330,  Not once
331,  Not even in some of her darkest hours
332, Maybe the clarity that grief and struggle bring will allow us to cast off the old parts of our lives thatnever served us well to begin with
333,  Maybe the resilience we've found facing a once in a generationchallenge has opened a path to new and better things
334,   Maybe it's time we remember what Margaret Mead was trying to teach her class during that lecturelong ago: that who we are is measured by how we care for those who need us
335,  And that wewouldn't be standing here today if that simple ancient value wasn't deeply ingrained into our veryexistence
336, Illinois
337,
338,
339,the state of our great state is STRONG
340,

1," Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday delivered her fourth State ofthe State address, commencing the second session of the 55th Legislature"
2,The text of the governor’s 2022 State of the State address as prepared is as follows:Good afternoon
3, Thank you Mr
4," Lieutenant Governor, Mr"
5," Speaker, Madam SenatePro Tem, distinguished senators and representatives, and my fellow New Mexicans,and Happy Birthday to my Mom: I am humbled, once again, to have theopportunity to address the state of our great state"
6,"I know there is a temptation to view today as the opening kickoff of a big game, orthe launch of some great battle"
7, Some will describe it that way
8," But I encourage youto do what you can to resist the perception of a “competition,” to avoid feeding aplotline that would pit one team against another"
9, This isn’t the sports page
10, We’reall here to do the people’s business
11, It’s a sacred thing
12, And we’re all on the sameteam today – and in fact every day
13,At the outset of every legislative session I encourage my colleagues in this buildingto think about the people we are all here to serve
14," I think about their dreams, theirhopes and fears; and I think about what service means, about what effectiveservice can deliver for the workers and families all across New Mexico who arerepresented here in this building – the entrepreneurs and job-creators, the seniorsand students, the New Mexicans of every background and belief system"
15," No, wedon’t agree on everything, and we don’t have to"
16," But I believe that the values weshare as New Mexicans still truly unite us: The desire to see our families grow andthrive, the willingness to work hard to enjoy what we earn, the optimism thattomorrow can and will be better than today, for ourselves and for our neighbors"
17,"In the last three years, this Legislature and this administration have gotten a lotdone"
18, We raised the minimum wage for the ﬁrst time in a decade
19, We’veguaranteed paid sick leave to every worker in the state
20, We made early education akey priority and have invested hundreds of millions into the future of our earliestlearners
21," We invested in new economic sectors and we’ve sent thousands moreNew Mexicans of every age and background to college for free, no strings attached"
22,And I could go on
23, I could talk for a long time about the good work of the last fewyears
24,"But we need to talk, instead, about what people are really feeling"
25, The needs of thismoment remain great
26," The grief, the loss, the volatility brought on by this hideouspandemic has wreaked havoc on the lives of every family, every American, everyhuman being around the planet"
27," And add on top of that inﬂation, a supply chaincrisis, gridlock in Washington: It’s all making it harder for everybody, and especiallyregular working people, to feel safe, to feel comfortable, to feel optimistic"
28, And weall feel it
29," My family and I, my daughters, my ﬁancé, my grandkids – all of us, thereare no exceptions"
30," New Mexicans are calling out for safety and stability, for moreand more equal opportunity, for an open and fair and free democracy that worksand works for them"
31,"Over these next 30 days, we can and we will answer that call, together"
32,"Once again, this incredible state, our home, is on the precipice of momentouspositive change"
33, I said that three years ago when I ﬁrst swore an oath to carry outthe duties of this ofﬁce to the best of my ability
34, It’s been true every day since then
35,"If anything the opportunity has grown, has multiplied exponentially; the sun isrising on a pivotal day, and I believe everything and anything is possible"
36,"We have, right now, unimaginable ﬁnancial resources at our disposal"
37," I believe wecan fulﬁll, once and for all, after a hundred-and-ten years of statehood, the destinyof New Mexico as a genuine homestead of the American Dream, a place wherepeople can grow and thrive and live in peace and prosperity, where people havethe resources they need to support themselves and their families"
38," What we do herenow, what we do in the coming weeks, will set the stage"
39,"Dating back decades, a timid mindset has afﬂicted people in this capitol building, apessimism that can be self-fulﬁlling"
40, Thinking small is a curse
41," Big and meaningfulchanges are possible, but the biggest change may be our attitude, our perspective"
42,"At a moment in time when we have the money to do it all, let’s not limit ourselves;let’s not be unnecessarily incremental"
43," Can’t New Mexico be a state – can’t we bethe state – where everything is possible?So, on that note, let’s give every single educator in this state a 7% raise this year,minimum"
44," That would be the biggest pay bump in recent memory, and it wouldput us ﬁrst in the region for average educator pay"
45," They deserve it, and we canafford it, and it’s the right thing to do"
46," Let’s also raise the starting salaries for everytier of educators, which means some teachers will see a 20% raise this year"
47, And letme be clear: This kind of progress pays for itself
48," When we support educators, whenwe retain high-quality teachers and keep our schools brimming with talentedprofessionals, our other strategic investments in New Mexico children and in publiceducation are supported and sustained"
49, Our graduation rates will continue to rise
50,"Our literacy rates will continue to improve, especially with a targeted new phonicsprogram that we have initiated and that the Legislature must continue to support"
51,We get more kids into high-quality apprenticeship programs and institutions ofhigher learning that will help them build fulﬁlling careers and lives
52," It all starts withdemonstrating support and respect for our educators; Day One, I said we would dothat, and we’re getting it done"
53,And we’re going to keep going: Let’s cut taxes for every single person in NewMexico
54, We haven’t cut the sales tax in this state in 40 years
55," It’s only gone up andup and up, for decades, burdening New Mexico households and making it harderfor our small businesses to be competitive"
56," But under my tax cut proposal, NewMexicans would save more than 170 million dollars every year"
57," As my colleaguesfrom across the aisle have pointed out in years past, correctly, that money doesn’tbelong in government accounts; it belongs in the pockets of hard-working NewMexicans"
58," I agree, and I expect the Legislature to prioritize this relief"
59,I feel the same way about the taxes that are taken out of social security beneﬁts
60,New Mexico is one of only a few states that taxes social security
61, I am calling todayfor that taxation to end
62, We must unburden the New Mexicans who rely on socialsecurity beneﬁts by cutting their taxes
63," This is good government, serving thepeople who have asked us to serve them"
64, New Mexicans deserve it
65," Because Ibelieve we have an obligation to ﬁnd ways to make life easier for the people of NewMexico, and I will keep looking for ways to do exactly that"
66,And there are more tax cuts on the horizon
67, Our expansion of the Working FamiliesTax Credit last year has already saved hundreds of dollars each for about a quarterof a million New Mexicans – the New Mexicans who need those savings the most
68,"Every dollar counts when we’re trying to support the middle class, when we’retrying to help workers build careers and help families build stability"
69," Next year, ahalf a million more New Mexico taxpayers will beneﬁt from these expanded credits"
70,This has been the most signiﬁcant and progressive reform of our tax code in ageneration; this is real and meaningful change that helps families keep the lightson and keep food on the table
71," This is money that is going right back into thepocket of the single mom, the small business owner, the veteran who served ourcountry and our state"
72," Day One, I said we were gonna make this economy work forthe everyday New Mexican, and we’re getting it done"
73, So let’s keep going
74, In thenext 12 months your state government is going to deliver an additional $230 millionin rent and utility assistance to the New Mexicans who need it most
75, Your stategovernment will continue to help keep the heat on in hundreds of thousands ofhouseholds across our state
76, We will not leave families behind
77," And if theLegislature provides the resources, your state government will do more than justhelp families stay aﬂoat; we can and we will genuinely invest in New Mexicofamilies and lift them up"
78, Because families don’t need to be worrying about asurprise medical bill or car repairs; they don’t need to worry about hunger either
79," Inthe ﬁrst two years of this administration, New Mexico reduced food insecurity at thesecond-best rate of any state in the country"
80, We all know there’s more to do
81, Butthat’s the kind of progress you can build on
82, It should inspire us to keep going
83,"Reducing poverty and shielding more families from its effects is the mostimportant work any government, any worker anywhere, can do"
84,"In the last year, we’re 11th best for job growth in the country overall"
85," In three years,we have created over ten thousand jobs in every corner of our state; and those jobsnow have an average salary better than $90,000 a year: That’s a record high, and it’sa big bright signal to other businesses, like the hundreds of businesses that haverelocated here in the last three years, showing them how successful our public-private partnerships can be, and how business-friendly New Mexico is"
86," We’recutting red tape, and it is making a real difference for New Mexico business owners;I’m thinking of folks like Maurice Lemus in Raton, who was seeing businessevaporate into Colorado before we made changes; he was the ﬁrst New Mexican toreceive a new liquor license under the long-overdue reform we enacted"
87," That kindof aggressive go-get-it attitude, supported by a proactive state government thatwants to actively support businesses, will not only keep more patrons in Maurice’srestaurant but help entrepreneurs throughout our state"
88, People see the economicpotential of New Mexico now; we’re creating a real pipeline of jobs and opportunity
89,We are the frontier of economic growth
90," Unlike in the aftermath of the GreatRecession, we’re not gonna let the pandemic stall us and take away years ofgrowth; we will not have another lost decade – in fact, despite the challenges of thelast two years, we’ve hardly lost a step"
91, The fact is: Unemployment has gone downevery month for 10 straight months
92, The number of unemployed New Mexicansdropped by 5 percent in November alone
93, We’re expanding our economic footprintinto every single community
94, Legal cannabis is going to create thousands of jobsand serious tax revenue for local governments to support local services in everycorner of our state
95," Almost forty thousand more students receiving high-qualitycollege education for free under my Opportunity Scholarship program means moreskilled workers building 21st-century careers right here in Roswell, Espanola,Sunland Park, Rio Rancho, Chama and so many more; the intellectual infrastructureof a nationally competitive state economy is being built right here, right now, oncampuses and in communities through our state"
96," And clean hydrogen will supportthousands of jobs, especially in rural New Mexico, while helping us sprint towardour net-zero carbon deadlines and decarbonize the transportation sector"
97,"But if we want to keep up our economic momentum, and we have to, we have gotto get crime under control"
98, I don’t accept the argument that this is an issue in onlyone part of our state
99, I don’t accept that any decision-maker in this building wouldsay that somehow this isn’t their problem
100, We all have a role to play in keeping NewMexico safe
101," Public safety doesn’t just exist on its own; we have to create it, andsupport it, and own it"
102," So we need tougher penalties for the worst of the worst, therepeat offenders and those who have proven themselves to be a danger to ourcommunities; I support rehabilitation and this administration has done a lot ofinnovative good work in that area, but at the end of the day I stand with thefamilies and communities who have been victimized unnecessarily by the violentcriminals that this system needs to secure"
103," The worst offenders, the most seriousand dangerous criminals in our state, need to be behind bars, simple as that"
104," Andwe are going to pass a law, this session, that will keep violent criminals behind barsuntil justice can be done"
105, We will put a wedge in the revolving door of violent crimein New Mexico
106, The safety of our communities cannot be up for debate
107, A smart-on-crime approach can work; it has worked
108," In my ﬁrst year in ofﬁce, violent crimewent down for the ﬁrst time in 6 years: We can regain that momentum when wemake sure our local communities (and public safety ofﬁcers) have the resourcesand support they need"
109,"So I am asking the Legislature for a 19% increase in the budget of the departmentof public safety to fund innovative new crime ﬁghting strategies and hundreds ofnew positions, including a 19% raise for our state police ofﬁcers"
110, And I am asking for100 million to support hiring and retention efforts to get a thousand more ofﬁcersin place statewide as quickly as we can
111, I am asking for those things because NewMexicans are asking for them
112, New Mexico is a state that respects and supports lawenforcement ofﬁcers
113, I reject the rhetoric from Washington and elsewhere that hasmade public safety a political battleground
114," This isn’t about politics; it’s about basichuman respect for one another: Respect from ofﬁcers to the people they serve, andrespect for ofﬁcers from the communities they protect"
115," If we have that, we canmove forward, uniﬁed, in our desire to clean up the streets of this state, to keepviolent criminals behind bars, and to ensure every day that justice is done, equally,under the law"
116,We all want safe communities
117, And we all want healthy communities
118," Thisadministration has made important strides: We have capped costs for life-savingmedications, we’ve protected safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions,we’ve invested in affordable care for thousands of lower-income families, we haveeliminated co-pays for behavioral health services and we’ve begun the great task ofrebuilding a mental health care infrastructure that was decimated"
119," But, still, toomany people, especially people in the rural areas of our state, don’t have timelyaccess to the health care they need – or access at all"
120, Every community deserveshigh-quality care
121, I propose a new Rural Health Care Delivery Fund that will providebridge ﬁnancing to communities that have been waiting for assistance to kickstartconstruction without massive upfront costs; state government can help ﬁll thesegaps
122," With interventions like these, communities like those in Valencia County aremoving toward securing a brand new hospital, after years of delays"
123," And withinvestments like those I have proposed in my executive budget, we will put tens ofmillions of dollars into new behavioral health services, expanding access totreatment for substance abuse, suicide interventions and more"
124," New Mexicans callme about this issue more than almost any other, and we will answer that call"
125,We can and must ensure that kind of service-delivery is available throughout thestate – we have the resources to do so
126," That means endowing our medical schoolwith 10 million dollars, ensuring that we keep our best and brightest here toprovide care for New Mexicans after they graduate"
127," That also means endowing ournursing school with the power of the state, ensuring more highly skilledprofessionals enter this all-important ﬁeld"
128," And it means, once and for all, deliveringthe health care families in the rural parts of our state still desperately need"
129," When Ivisited Clayton last year I met Eloise Valdez, 92 years young, whose family cares forher 24/7"
130, It’s not easy
131," Thousands of New Mexicans are living the same story, unableto pay for outside help, because it’s too expensive, and it’s not covered"
132," As acaregiver myself, I know the strength and resilience it takes; I know it can bephysically and mentally exhausting"
133," Well, I think it’s time we start saying thank you,and I propose a dramatic expansion of the state program that directly supportscaregivers; what that means is we are going to pay families who are doing the workof taking care of their elderly loved ones, regardless of Medicaid eligibility"
134," Let’s callit New Mexi-Care, and let’s make it a model program for the rest of the country"
135," Thisis an investment in people that goes well beyond politics or any one politician; thisis the kind of investment that can be and should be a lasting service, one thatreﬂects our shared values as a state"
136," In this state, we provide for and care for ourparents, our grandparents, our disabled loved ones"
137," This state government, undermy leadership, will help provide for that care, unequivocally"
138," Caregiving is a full-time job, I know it ﬁrst-hand; and we respect working people in New Mexico"
139," Let’sinvest in the dignity of our elders, and of their families, by helping caregivers andthose they care for stay in their homes with the ﬁnancial support they need"
140,"On the same note, it is time that we build a new veterans home – a state-of-the-artindependent assisted-living facility for those who sacriﬁced to protect ourfreedoms"
141, The original building on the campus in T or C was built in 1936
142, I think it’stime for an upgrade
143," So I am calling for 60 million dollars, which we will leveragewith an additional $60 million from the federal government, to build the kind ofmodern facility our veterans, and their families, deserve"
144, We’re going to get it done
145,"Because when government has the right tools, and the right people, problems aresolved"
146," Yeah, we can dream big and make bold plans – it doesn’t matter much ifwe’re not solving people’s problems, each day"
147, And we are
148," Just a few months ago,Veterans Service Ofﬁcer Dagmar Youngberg in Carlsbad took a call from a veteranwho needed some help taking a fresh look at an old beneﬁts claim, a claim thathad been denied for decades"
149, This state employee at the Department of VeteransServices did some digging and got to work talking with the feds about what wentwrong
150," Turns out, a lot went wrong"
151," In the end, Ms"
152," Youngberg helped this disabledveteran get full back pay dating back 20 years, recovering 738,000 dollars in totalthat was owed to this individual, a person who served their state and their country"
153,She helped this veteran get off food stamps and pay off their mom’s mortgage
154, Thisis a government that is solving problems
155," And here’s why: Because it’s ﬁlled withNew Mexicans, and New Mexicans look out for their neighbors; we make the extraeffort to do what’s right; we get up when we’ve been knocked down and we ﬁghtfor what’s ours"
156,  The state of our state is ready to move forward
157, Ready to rise
158, We have all the toolswe need
159," My vision is this: Communities all across our state where families aren’tworried about the next bill, or their kids’ future, or a job market or health caresystem that doesn’t quite seem to work for them"
160," My vision is a New Mexico wherethe founding ideals of this great country – equal opportunity and justice for all – aremade real, and meaningful; where the pursuit of happiness is more than a phrasefrom a dusty piece of paper; it’s something tangible, something everyone canactually feel"
161,We can do it all
162, We have the ﬁnances
163, We’re going to fund an unprecedented suiteof new affordable housing programs at the state level
164, We’re going to expandprotections for voters because we believe in democracy and everyone’s right tovote
165," I subscribe to an optimism that says: Big things are within our reach, and blueskies are ahead – and hopefully some snow, too"
166,"When my grandfather was a young man he traveled across this state, across mesasand over mountains, in a covered wagon"
167," He never could have imagined that bythe time he was an old man he would see the Sandias from 30,000 feet in anairplane"
168, He never could have imagined his granddaughter would watch a rocketblast off and literally reach space from New Mexico
169, None of us can predict thefuture
170," It feels unsettled, especially these days"
171," But what I know, for a certainty, isthat we have the power to make that kind of a bold leap into the unknown beyond,together; we have the power to envision a bright tomorrow, and to execute thatvision, on behalf of the people"
172, And we must recommit ourselves to that unifyingpurpose today
173,"So for the next 30 days, let’s be aggressive on behalf of the New Mexicans we’re allhere to serve"
174, Let’s remember who beneﬁts from good public service
175," It’s not aboutpolitics, it’s about community: Your community; our community; the families andworkers and seniors and parents who just want to live in peace, and with dignity,conﬁdent in the promise of tomorrow and the stability of today"
176, We’ve made somuch progress
177, Let’s make sure New Mexicans feel it
178, Let’s go above and beyondand embrace the potential of this pivotal moment in time

273,"”Jacky, I couldn’t agree more—which is why I’ll be introducing legislation that allowsmiddle- and low-income families and students with an individualized educational plan toreceive a portion of the ‘per pupil’ funds allocated annually by the state to move their childto the education system of their choice"
274,"About 70% (over $5,300) of those funds will go directly into an account for families tocustomize their child’s education"
275, The remaining 30% will be distributed by the state tosmaller school districts
276," We want to ensure our small schools stay strong while, at the same time, empoweringparents to choose what’s best for their child"
277," As I said last year, school choice isn’t a zero sum game"
278, It has the potential to raise thequality of all schools

280,"” That is precisely what we want: For every school, public or private, to strive to be the bestit can be"
281," Because when our schools succeed, Iowa becomes a “destination of choice” forparents everywhere"

0," ** 2022 State of the State Address, as prepared for delivery ** Good afternoon"
1," Generally, when a Governor delivers a State of the State message, it happens in the Assembly Chamber in Carson City before a Legislative Session"
2,"  This year, there is no session, but with the pandemic receding I thought it was important to talk to you about our path forward"
3,"  That's why I decided to give a State of the State address here at Allegiant Stadium - a location that represents new jobs, new determination, new pride, and new progress for Nevada"
4," What you see here — this state-of-the-art building, the thousands of jobs that came with it, the incredible sports and entertainment it hosts - it all came together because people worked together: Republicans and Democrats, business and labor, north and south"
5," And you know what, that’s always the best way to get things done"
6," We got this and a lot of other things accomplished in the middle of a pandemic, because despite dealing with the worst health crisis in a century, we kept going, people persevered, determined to get things done for Nevadans: Today, our economy is one of the fastest growing in the country"
7," Tourism is up, unemployment is down"
8, Our students are back - with 100% of our classrooms in-person
9," Gaming revenues are at an all-time high, and, more importantly, wages are up, too"
10," But it’s been hard, we still face challenges every day, and the pain of the pandemic is real"
11, We’ve lost cherished friends and family
12, Our healthcare professionals and first responders have worked night and day saving countless lives
13," Teachers, administrators and support staff like bus drivers and cafeteria workers went above and beyond to get our kids back in classrooms safely"
14,"   1 Our Nevada National Guard members stepped forward to run testing stations, distribute vaccines, and care for seniors"
15," Our small businesses had to sharpen their pencils, care for their employees – while finding new ways to keep their doors open"
16," Families had to adapt: Helping kids study, working from home, trying to keep it all together"
17, The truth is we never gave up
18," And while we still have a lot more to do, we refused to let the pandemic stop our progress"
19,"  Quite simply, because of you, the state of our state is resilient and getting stronger every day"
20, Nevada is on the move
21," I’m so proud of our state, and of our people"
22," Because despite the noise we hear from some in politics, despite the partisanship that can distract and divide, I know that at our core we all care about the same things a paycheck that keeps up with cost of living, schools that teach, streets that are safe, businesses that thrive and create good jobs and a government that lives within its means"
23," Today, I’m going to talk about how, working together, we can get more done to help make your life better"
24," Right now, the cost of everything is rising"
25, We all see it
26, Nevada families are getting squeezed at the pump and at the grocery store
27," Childcare, housing, and healthcare costs are eating too much of a family’s income"
28, It’s hard to keep ahead of bills and save for things like college or retirement
29," While I can’t promise to solve the national inflation problem, I can promise to do everything in my power to help families with the rising cost of living"
30,    2 That starts with holding the line on taxes
31," Since I’ve been governor, we haven’t raised one penny of new taxes on the people of Nevada, not one penny, and that’s also true of every proposal I’m offering tonight – no new taxes, no new taxes"
32, These issues are important to me because I’ve been there
33," I raised two incredible daughters by myself, cooking dinners they didn’t like, going to the grocery store, trying to figure out childcare"
34,  Raising kids isn’t easy or cheap -- and that was over 20 years ago
35, Things have only gotten more expensive
36," So,  we’re  starting  by  investing  in  childcare  -  because  Nevadans  deserve  the opportunity  to  go  to  work  knowing  their  children  are  safe  and  have  every opportunity to succeed"
37," In the last two years we strengthened Nevada Ready!, the State’s Pre-K program, to get high-quality childcare and early education to more kids"
38," We invested over $200 million in childcare centers, to keep staff working and facilities open"
39,"  And today, I’m announcing a further investment of $160 million to help lower costs for parents and keep childcare workers on the job"
40, This investment will double the number of families we support because I believe every family from West Wendover to North Las Vegas should have access to great childcare
41, Another big concern is the rising cost of housing
42," Right now, we have too little supply for a booming demand"
43," In the last decade more than 400,000 people have moved into Nevada"
44,"  They know what a great state this is, but we have renters and buyers at all levels who are being squeezed out of the market"
45, That’s why we’ve taken steps to remedy our housing shortage
46," We provided rental assistance that helped over 43,000 Nevada families remain in their homes"
47," We helped build over 2,300 new affordable apartments last year alone"
48, For those thousands of families what really matters is keeping a roof over their head or building equity in a home
49, But there’s more to be done
50,"  3 That’s why today, I’m announcing the “Home Means Nevada” initiative – a $500 million dollar commitment to lower the cost of housing, help people stay in their homes, and create good-paying jobs"
51, The plan boosts housing construction and homeownership opportunities
52," It will help seniors retrofit their homes, to lower their costs, improve their property, and stay where they want to be"
53," And we are developing a new partnership with the AFL-CIO through our state infrastructure bank, to help fund new housing developments"
54,  This announcement marks the single largest investment in housing in our state’s history
55," Like housing, I know the rising costs of healthcare also pose a serious strain on many Nevada families"
56, I have been working with Democrats and Republicans to help solve that problem
57, We went after insurance companies and made it illegal to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions
58, We were one of the first states to crack down on “surprise billing” by hospitals and medical providers
59, We took on medical debt collectors who were preying on struggling families
60," We helped over 100,000 Nevadans purchase affordable health insurance through the Silver State Health Exchange"
61, And our new public health insurance option will make quality care affordable for even more Nevadans
62, That’s real progress
63, But we can’t let up
64," For instance, the cost of insulin has tripled over the last decade to nearly $300 per vial"
65, Lifesaving cancer drugs can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
66,"    4 That’s why today, I’m announcing that Nevada will join the Northwest Prescription Drug Consortium, along with Oregon and Washington State"
67," By negotiating with drug companies together, we can start holding them accountable and get costs down"
68," But we all know healthcare isn’t just about costs, it’s about people and it’s about jobs"
69," In the coming weeks, I’ll be creating a Healthcare Workforce Committee to build on the lessons learned over the last two years"
70," We must ensure we have the nurses,  technicians,  and  doctors  we  need  so  Nevadans  can  get  the  care  they deserve"
71, Now I want to talk about one of my very top priorities
72," As someone who went to public school and as the dad of two daughters who did the same, I know how important a great education is"
73, That’s why I’ve been so passionate about getting our kids back in the classroom
74, During the pandemic we deployed $1
75,"5 billion in federal funds for masks, testing, mental health support and more - so we could reopen schools safely"
76," I am so grateful for our hardworking teachers, support staff, our exhausted parents, and our amazing students"
77, We would not be where we are today without you
78, When I took office
79, I promised to do everything in my power to make sure every child in every classroom gets a great education
80, That’s why we gave teachers their first directly funded raise in a decade
81," Why we asked educators what they needed and directly funded 11,000 projects to make schoolrooms buzz"
82, And why we raised average per pupil funding to a new high
83," And when I said I would do everything in my power to help our schools, I meant everything"
84, That’s why I’ve donated every penny of my salary as governor directly to our public schools
85," Almost $300,000 donated to more than 100 different schools across our state -- from Southside Elementary School in Elko to Basic High School in Henderson"
86,  5 And I want to take a moment to speak directly to parents and caregivers
87," Your voices, your involvement, your thoughts are an important part of great schools"
88, I will always support strong parent participation in making our education system the best it can be
89, I really believe that the future of our state is directly tied to the quality of our schools
90," Last year, I worked with the legislature to commit $200 million to get our students caught up after the pandemic"
91," This investment is going to summer schools, tutors, and other efforts to make sure our kids are back on track and ready to get ahead"
92," We’re also going to invest in teacher recruitment by providing nearly 4,000 future educators  with  stipends  and  tuition  assistance  to  help  address  the  teacher shortage"
93," Finally, we all know that you can’t learn on an empty stomach"
94," So, I’m announcing that we're investing federal dollars to ensure that our schools can provide free lunch for all students across the state for the next school year"
95," While we want to make sure our kids are cared for at school… we all deserve to be safe at home, at work and in our neighborhoods"
96, No exceptions
97, That’s why next I want to talk about something every Nevadan is concerned about
98, We’ve seen crime rates rise across the country and here at home
99," Whether it’s a 44% increase in homicides last year in Clark County, or an increase in robberies in Reno - it is unacceptable"
100, Here are some of things we are doing to turn things around
101," We banned bump stocks, closed the gun show loophole and now require common-sense background checks on all gun sales"
102," We secured nearly $12 million in federal funding to recruit more officers, prevent youth crime, and more"
103," And under my administration, the percentage of our state budget devoted to law enforcement is #1 in the country"
104,  6 But there are still some big holes we need to fill
105," For example, our state police make less than most municipal officers and as a result we have a shortage of State Police"
106,"  If  you’re  someone  who  is  interested  in  a  law  enforcement  career,  go  to DPS"
107,NV
108,GOV because we need you
109,"  And here’s my promise back –- when the legislature returns to Carson City, I will be proposing a salary increase, so we guarantee that Nevada state police are well-trained and well-paid"
110," And as we work at the state level, we need our local law enforcement agencies to evaluate the crime-fighting programs they have, while our courts and prosecutors help determine the best ways to reduce crime in their communities"
111, I have always supported increases in funding for our police to make sure they have the resources and training to protect and respect the communities they serve
112," As Governor, I will continue to partner with anyone and everyone – Democrat, Republican, or Independent – to make our communities safe and to make sure our police have the support they need"
113," I’ve talked about a lot of issues today: safety in our community, the cost of living, healthcare, and education"
114," But the truth is, a vibrant, growing economy with good paying jobs goes a long way towards solving many of these challenges"
115, That’s why I’ve been working to build a stronger and more diverse economic foundation for Nevada -- to help create an economy that works for you and Nevada families
116, This stadium is an example of just that
117," It’s created thousands of new jobs -- from construction to transportation, from small business suppliers to technical staff, from the tax dollars it generates, to the hotel rooms it fills"
118, This building represents one part of a more diversified economic future
119, And we’re building it together
120,"  7 Last year alone, Nevada added over 94,000 jobs to our economy"
121, We’ve been rated the state with the best economic momentum in the country
122, Over 100 startups launched in Reno in the last two years alone
123," And, yes, tourism is back"
124, Hotel room revenue is up and our newly expanded Las Vegas Convention Center is getting booked
125, That means jobs for our workers and tax revenue for our state
126, This didn’t happen by accident
127," During the pandemic we did everything we could to keep small businesses open, attract new companies to the state, and support our workers"
128,"  In December, I hosted the JobFest, which was attended by 2,100 Nevadans"
129," One hundred and eighty-two employers hired 251 attendees, all in just one day"
130," And those jobs aren’t statistics, they’re people, like the woman who came up to me after being unemployed for months"
131, She got hired on the spot and on that day her life – and her family's life – changed
132," When she cried and hugged me, it proved again what a good job means in a person's life"
133, Another huge economic growth opportunity for us is clean energy
134," With more sunshine than just about any state in the nation, Nevada is on the way to becoming the leading clean-energy economy in America"
135," Last year alone, we saw the launch of five new solar plants - increasing our state’s solar capacity by 36%, and now Nevada is ranked #1 for solar in the country"
136," Renewable  Energy  Tax  Abatements  have  created  12,000  construction  and  500 operational jobs with an average wage of more than $40 hour"
137," We’re investing in things like clean-energy school buses, which will be funded, in part, by fines on corporate polluters"
138," These aren’t just good jobs, they’re critical tools in the fight against climate change"
139," From the day I took office, I’ve worked to make sure Nevada is resilient as it tackles this serious threat"
140,"  8 Today, we’re monitoring our carbon footprint"
141, We’re investing in transportation electrification across Nevada
142," We’re implementing a plan to ensure that 50% of Nevada’s energy comes from clean energy by 2030, with net-zero greenhouse gasses by 2050"
143, But we can and we must do more
144, Climate change puts us all at risk
145," Drought, wildfire, Lake Mead’s record low, it affects us every day"
146,  Extreme heat is another one
147," That’s why this year, I'll convene members of my Cabinet, scientists, and climate leaders to create a statewide strategy for dealing with extreme heat"
148, We will continue leading the fight against climate change and creating good jobs in the process
149," Because a resilient, clean energy economy is a part of a strong, diversified economy"
150, And let’s not forget the essential role that small business plays in our economy
151, I know something about this
152, I was a small business owner myself
153," And I faced the struggles  that  come  with  starting  a  business,  praying  that  your  idea  will  be successful"
154, It was one of the most terrifying and most exciting periods of my life
155, Nevada business owners deserve a government that is invested in their success and stays out of their way
156, That’s why I stopped any increase in unemployment insurance taxes in 2022
157, It’s why  we  distributed  $100  million  to  thousands  of  organizations  and  small businesses to keep them going during the pandemic
158, And why I have worked to reduce unnecessary regulation
159," For  example,  today  I’m  announcing  a  bi-partisan  task  force  to  further  reduce barriers  when  it  comes  to  occupational  licensing"
160,"  Here  in  Nevada,  we  license everyone from barbers to private investigators and the system needs to change"
161," I’m also creating the first ever Nevada Small Business Accelerator Program -- to help new startups get off the ground and expand, putting Nevada at the forefront of emerging technologies"
162,"  9 And one more thing: To make sure more money drops to the bottom line, I will keep Nevada a low tax state"
163," The fact is, as we work to grow the economy, we need great roads, bridges, and highways to move materials and create jobs"
164," The  good  news  is  that,  today,  we’re  actually  ranked  number  1  of  all  states  in infrastructure, and we’re in the top 10 for our roads and highways"
165, That’s real progress
166, But we’re about to make another leap forward
167,"  Using dollars from the federal bipartisan infrastructure bill I supported, and our federal delegation delivered, we will invest $4 billion dollars to upgrade roads, bridges,  and  water  systems"
168,"  Over  five  hundred  million  for  new  broadband infrastructure, to make sure every Nevadan has access to high-speed internet"
169, Big new improvements to our airports and public transportation systems
170, And over $8 million dollars to try and get our hands around wildfire prevention
171," These investments -- overwhelmingly supported by Democrats, Republicans and Independents -- will create thousands of new union jobs, the building blocks of an even stronger economy"
172," And as we continue to move forward, we need to make sure no Nevadan gets left behind"
173, I’ve always believed the key to a good job doesn’t always have to run through the gates of a four-year college
174, That’s why  I’ve worked to create new career and technical training opportunities for students and those looking for retraining
175," We’ve already expanded STEM education, and apprenticeship programs, with over 30,000 students completing training since I took office"
176," And we’ve created new opportunities for over 10,000 high school students to begin earning their associate degree while finishing their high school diploma"
177,"  10 And last, but certainly not least, we know that skills training is essential to our workers and businesses"
178," A high school education isn’t enough, and we should recognize that it’s no longer “pre-school through grade 12,” but at least “pre-school through community college or other post high school training"
179,"” For that reason, I’m directing my Workforce Development Committee to explore ways to make community college or other apprentice and training programs free for more Nevadans by 2025"
180, I know we can get it done
181," Nevada, I have never been more optimistic about our state or where we are going"
182," Despite two difficult years that have challenged every one of us, again and again I’ve seen incredible acts of kindness, heroic acts of selflessness and a determination to never stop moving forward"
183," Family has never been more important – I know that’s true for me as I look over at my wife Kathy and my two daughters, Carley and Ashley"
184," Ultimately this is about making life better for the people we love – I think that’s true for all of us – when we get up each day, go to our jobs, provide for our kids, try to make budgets work, or care for a parent"
185," We’re  believers  --  that  problems  can  be  solved,  that  big  things  can  be accomplished – whether it’s a stadium that unites us, a new job that excites us, or a classroom that ignites something special in a young child, we’re united in our determination"
186," As I said in my opening, getting things done always works best when we come together – when we put aside party labels, put down our heads, and get to work"
187,  That’s the true Battle Born spirit that has propelled our state forward for the last 157 years
188," It is what I try to do every day as your governor, and with your help, it’s what will build an even stronger Nevada"
189, Thank you

1," Governor Hall-Long, Mister Speaker, Mister President Pro Temp, Members of the 151st General Assembly, Members of the Cabinet, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, and my fellow Delawareans:   Thank you for inviting me into the chamber today"
2, I wish we could have more people with us
3,  And thank you to those tuning in virtually
4,"   On January 23, 2020, I stood in this same spot to deliver the State of the State address"
5, The chamber was packed
6, The word “coronavirus” meant nothing to most of us
7, We were looking forward to a bright year ahead
8,"   Our plans did not include a global pandemic, I can tell you"
9,"  So while we canceled our plans and turned our attention to beating this pandemic, so too did the people of Delaware"
10,   These last two years have brought unprecedented challenges for every Delaware family
11,   Many have lost loved ones
12, Others lost their business
13, Our children missed important time in classrooms
14," We missed sports games, graduations, weddings, and funerals"
15, Every one of us has experienced some type of loss during this pandemic
16,"   If nothing else, we all have that in common"
17,"   And as we’ve learned the hard way over the past few weeks, we aren’t through it yet"
18,  More than 300 members of the Delaware National Guard are at work right now helping take pressure off our hospitals
19, And getting Delawareans tested and vaccinated
20,"   I want to thank General Berry, our Guardsmen and women, and all our healthcare workers, for your incredible efforts"
21,  Please help me thank these public servants
22,  I also want to thank Dr
23, Karyl Rattay and her entire public health team for their hard work and resilience
24,"    And I want to recognize DEMA Director AJ Schall, his team and all our emergency personnel across our state for their great work"
25,"   1  As Prepared for Delivery   Over the last year, Director Schall, Dr"
26, Rattay and their teams helped deliver more than 1
27,6 million vaccines to Delawareans
28,  Our Lieutenant Governor was instrumental in those efforts
29," She rallied communities, worked vaccine sites, and went out into neighborhoods, making sure people in every corner of our state had access to the vaccines"
30,"   And community leaders stepped up big – people like Reverend Rita Paige, Bernice Edwards, Darryl Chambers and his team, and Maria Matos"
31,"   Because of the efforts of so many, we were one of only 20 states to meet President Biden’s goal – 70 percent of adults vaccinated by July 4"
32,   This work saved lives
33,   We provided more than $400 million in support to small businesses
34," We supported child care providers, who stayed on the job throughout this crisis"
35,"   And thanks to the hard work of educators, we got our children back in classrooms"
36,"   That’s why, despite the trying times – and because of the ongoing sacrifice of so many Delawareans – I’m optimistic today"
37,"   Over the past two years, we’ve seen clearly that the people of our state are resilient"
38, They’re innovative
39, They’re kind
40, They never give up
41, They’re focused on the present – but hopeful for the future
42,   Because of the incredible strength of the people of our state
43, And because of their resilience
44, I can tell you confidently today that the state of our state is strong
45,   And we are eager for what lies ahead
46,"  As we recover from this pandemic, it’s clear that expanding economic opportunity for all Delaware families must be job number one"
47,   We can all agree on this: a good job solves a lot of problems
48,  So let’s start there
49,"  On my first day in office in 2017, we partnered with the private sector to strengthen our economic development efforts"
50,"    2  As Prepared for Delivery   Working with all of you, we created the Delaware Prosperity Partnership"
51,   And that idea has paid off
52,"   Despite the pandemic, Delaware employers have added nearly 20,000 new jobs"
53, The DPP helped them retain thousands more
54,   Delaware’s economy has rebounded from the worst effects of COVID-19 more quickly than we could’ve imagined
55,"   Our unemployment rate is now just above 5 percent, down from a high of 13"
56,4 percent in April 2020
57,"   Just last month, financial technology startup Investor Cash Management – or ICM – announced that it would move its headquarters from Chicago to downtown Wilmington"
58,  ICM plans to invest $15 million in its new headquarters and create almost 400 new jobs
59,   Prelude Therapeutics – an innovative company focused on new and effective cancer treatments - has just signed a 13-year lease for a new headquarters at DuPont’s old Chestnut Run campus
60,  The company grew out of the Delaware Innovation Space – our partnership with the University of Delaware and DuPont at the Experimental Station to support startup tech companies
61,   Incyte is another growing company with roots in the Delaware Innovation Space
62," Their new building in Wilmington, which is almost complete, will accommodate 500 employees"
63,   We’re building Delaware’s economy for the future
64,   I especially want to thank members of the General Assembly who sit on the board of the DPP:   •  Senator Jack Walsh •  Senator Brian Pettyjohn •  Representative Bill Bush •  And Representative Lyndon Yearick  We appreciate their participation and feedback
65,"   As they can tell you, these new jobs are not just confined to the northern part of our state"
66,   Baltimore-based textile manufacturer Avalon Industries is relocating and expanding in Dover
67,"    3  As Prepared for Delivery   Miller Metal, a longtime leader in Delaware manufacturing, is adding jobs in Bridgeville"
68,   And WuXi STA Pharmaceuticals is preparing to add 500 jobs and a half a billion dollars in capital investment at a massive new manufacturing facility in Middletown
69,   We also have some fun news on the tourism front
70,"   In March, the Atlantic 10 Conference will bring its women’s basketball Championship to the Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington"
71,"     And in August, Wilmington Country Club will host the PGA and thousands of fans for the BMW Championship"
72,   Delaware is on the map – and the future is bright
73,"   And in terms of national and international attention, it certainly doesn’t hurt to be home of the President of the United States"
74,   Support from the federal government – and our President Joe Biden – will help us build on this economic work in communities up and down our state
75,"   Using federal stimulus dollars, we’ll build and upgrade libraries in every county"
76,   We’ll help nonprofits modernize their buildings so they can better serve the people of our state
77,    We’ll significantly increase resources for our gun violence prevention program in Wilmington and Dover
78,"   Working with many of you and House Majority Leader Longhurst in particular, we’ll use federal money to improve our state’s mental health services"
79,  We’ll supercharge our state’s largest infrastructure plan
80,"   We’ll repair roads and bridges, invest even more in public transit, and build out electric vehicle infrastructure"
81, So important for the future
82,"  That will make commutes shorter, improve safety on our roads, and prepare Delaware for the future"
83,"   We’re also investing in our environment, and we have a new Climate Action Plan to address the effects of climate change"
84, Not just because it’s the right thing to do
85,    4  As Prepared for Delivery   But because we know that vibrant outdoor spaces help attract new workers and families
86, I especially want to thank Senator Hansen for her work to protect our natural environment
87,   Delaware State Parks continue to be among the best in the country
88,   And you don’t have to take my word for it
89,"  In November, our Parks again received the National Gold Medal for Excellence"
90,   Delaware is one of only two states to win this award twice
91,    Everyone should get out and enjoy our parks
92,"  When I release my budget next week, we’ll set aside another $30 million for open space and farmland preservation"
93, And Delaware has one of the most robust programs in the country
94,"  Through a years-long partnership with Majority Leaders Longhurst and Townsend and your good work, we created the Clean Water Trust Fund"
95,"   With federal support, we’ll be investing more than $400 million in Delaware’s clean water infrastructure"
96, And we’re focused on underserved communities
97, This is an unprecedented opportunity to fix longstanding problems
98,"    We all need to do our part to keep our natural areas clean, and free of trash"
99, Just look around
100, It’s a mess
101,   That’s why we’re continuing our efforts to Keep DE Litter Free
102, That’s our slogan
103, I am determined to help clean up our highways and byways
104,   All these investments will strengthen our economy for the future
105,"   We know that nationally, and in Delaware, small businesses drive job creation"
106,"   That’s why, for the first time ever, we put a hyper focus on small business inside state government"
107,   That includes supporting innovative new tech companies and mom-and-pop mainstream businesses
108,"   Since 2019, our EDGE Grants program has supported more than 35 small businesses"
109, These businesses are creating jobs and poised for growth
110,"    5  As Prepared for Delivery   At the same time, we invested more than $400 million in pandemic relief dollars to shore up businesses hardest hit by the pandemic – like bars and restaurants, museums, child care centers, and hotels"
111,  Business owners tell me this helped them keep their doors open
112,   Supporting businesses also means supporting the employees who work there
113,   We know workers are not just looking for a job
114," They’re looking for a way of life, especially as they start a young family"
115,   They believe that good jobs should also support their families when they need that support the most
116,  And I agree
117,  Senator McBride has introduced legislation that would build on the work we’ve done for state employees and extend paid leave into the private sector
118,  It’s the right thing to do - and it will make Delaware more attractive for younger workers
119,  I’d like to thank Senator McBride and Representative Heffernan for their leadership on this important issue
120,"  With the leadership of Senator Walsh, we also set Delaware on course to a $15 minimum wage"
121,   We are taking the lead in state government
122," Two years ago, we made a commitment to make sure every state employee makes at least $15 an hour"
123,"   Next week, when I release my budget, we’ll talk more about how we’re supporting state employees on the lower end of the wage scale"
124,"   Going forward, building a workforce ready for jobs of the future may be our biggest challenge – here in Delaware and across the nation"
125,"   Delaware employers have more than 33,000 open positions right now"
126," But only 26,000 Delawareans are actively looking for work"
127,"   Across the country, there are 10"
128,"5 million open positions, but only 6"
129,8 million applicants
130,  That’s why we’re investing more than $50 million in federal stimulus funds to strengthen our workforce training programs
131,  6  As Prepared for Delivery    We’re also expanding Pathways programs in public middle schools and high schools
132,"  By next year, these public-private investments will expand the Pathways program to reach more than 6,000 middle school students and 80 percent of high school students"
133,"  That will help students like Imani Wulff-Cochrane, whom I met recently"
134, Imani is a senior at St
135, George’s Tech
136," She spends a third of her day in an early childhood center, learning on the job"
137,  Imani’s focus on work-based learning will prepare her to enter the workforce as soon as she graduates from high school
138,"    Ultimately, I believe that expanding economic opportunity for everyone must start in the classroom"
139, Over the past five years – working with all of you – we have made significant new investments in public education
140,"   From Wilmington to Dover to Georgetown, we’re investing more than $300 million in the next two years for new school construction"
141,"   I want to thank members of the Bond Bill committee – and your chairs, Senator Poore and Representative Heffernan – for your support and leadership"
142,  We know the pandemic put a strain on every part of our education system – from school bus drivers to classroom teachers to school nurses
143," Please join me in thanking our educators, and everyone who works in our schools for their incredible efforts"
144,"    Amidst all these challenges, last year, the General Assembly made permanent new resources to support low-income students and English learners in public schools"
145,"    Thanks to Representative Williams and Senator Poore, we finally invested in K-3 basic special education"
146,  And it’s making a real difference in classrooms
147,"   One thing that the past two years have taught me is that there is value in acknowledging, and celebrating, the complexity of our state"
148, And our complex and often difficult history
149," That’s why I was proud to sign Representative Dorsey Walker’s bill into law, ensuring that a robust, accurate, Black history curriculum is taught in Delaware public schools"
150,   I was also fortunate to join Black clergy and community leaders in visiting the newly discovered African Burial Ground at the John Dickinson Plantation
151," And to partner with the Department of  7  As Prepared for Delivery   State, the Office of Statewide Equity Initiatives, the Delaware Heritage Commission, and Delaware State University to tell the public the real history of that site"
152,"  Over the past few months, I’ve been focused on making sure we finally deliver for the children of the City of Wilmington"
153,"   Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators, children in our largest city are not getting the education they need to be successful in life"
154,  We can do better – and we must
155, These children and their families deserve our best efforts
156,"   Over the last month, I’ve knocked doors and talked directly to parents and students"
157,   I know they’re eager for change
158, They want better
159,"  I’ve talked to, and heard from, educators in our City schools"
160,  The idea of the Wilmington Learning Collaborative is based on models we’ve seen be successful in other parts of the country
161,"   We’re asking districts that serve our students in the city – Red Clay, Brandywine, and Christina – to work together on behalf of these children"
162,   This model will place more decision-making in the hands of educators and local communities
163," And it’ll offer more support for students, families, and importantly the teachers in the classroom"
164,  It will place a hyper focus on these students and the challenges they face
165,"  It doesn’t solve every problem, to be sure"
166,   We will continue to work with Senator Lockman and the Redding Consortium to focus on issues around redistricting and the high school challenge for city students
167, These are certainly important issues
168,   But we can’t let those issues hold us up
169,   We can’t afford to wait
170, And we can’t afford to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result
171,   Please join me in finally doing right by these children
172,    8  As Prepared for Delivery   We know that a good education is not the only thing children and families need in order to be successful
173,   State Housing Director Eugene Young and his team have been working hard to address a housing crisis that has been made worse by the pandemic
174,"   Using federal funds, the State Housing Authority is partnering with the private sector to rebuild the Riverside community in northeast Wilmington"
175, It’s a very exciting project
176,  The Housing Authority has made available $50 million in rental and mortgage assistance to Delawareans struggling to get by across our state
177,"   And over the next three years, we will invest federal dollars to revitalize and develop more than 1,200 affordable housing units in Kent and Sussex counties"
178, That’s in addition to expanding down payment and settlement assistance for homebuyers
179,   These investments will go a long way to support Delawareans who need it most – and strengthen our economy at the same time
180,   It’s also way past time to make sure every home and business is connected to the internet
181,"    Currently, close to 11,600 Delaware homes and businesses lack access to high-speed broadband"
182,"   Delawareans rely on stable internet connections to apply for jobs, help their children do homework, work from home, or continue their education online"
183,   We’re investing over $100 million in federal money to make sure everyone has access to a hardwired connection
184, Mostly in Kent and Sussex counties
185,  We also continue to tackle the epidemic of substance abuse statewide
186, Our Lieutenant Governor’s leadership of the Behavioral Health Consortium is having a real impact
187,"   Despite the national rise in overdose rates during COVID, Delaware was one of only four states to see a decrease in the rate of overdose deaths"
188,   The Lieutenant Governor will continue to be a driving force to ensure access to treatment and prevention
189,"   I also want to take this opportunity to thank my wife, Tracey, for her support during this challenging time"
190, And for her relentless advocacy on behalf of children across our state
191,    9  As Prepared for Delivery   She always reminds me how much children have sacrificed through this pandemic to keep their families and communities safe
192,"   Through her First Chance Delaware initiative, Tracey has put a spotlight on issues facing children and has shown the value of working together"
193,   Through Trauma Matters Delaware – and in partnership with Casey Family Programs – Tracey is tackling the effects of trauma on Delaware children and families
194,"   Tracey has also partnered with the Food Bank of Delaware, which has stepped up time and again during this pandemic"
195," I’d like to thank the Food Bank, its workers, and volunteers for their incredible work"
196,   Probably our most popular statewide initiative this year has been Tracey’s work with the Dolly Parton Imagination Library
197, Everybody loves Dolly
198,   This program provides free books to children – enrolling newborns before they leave the hospital – and helps families build libraries that can last generations
199,   Please join me in thanking Tracey for her work
200,   Let me be clear about this point – and you won’t be surprised to hear it
201,"   We can’t make investments in public education – or infrastructure, or public safety - without a long-term, sustainable financial plan"
202,   Responsibly managing our state budget is more important than ever
203,   And it’s what every taxpayer I’ve ever talked to expects
204,"   Over the past five years, we have worked hard – and worked together – to get our state budget in order"
205," I’d like to thank members of the JFC – and your chairs, Senator Paradee and Representative Carson – for your work"
206,    We have built significant new reserves and directed one-time revenue into one-time infrastructure projects
207,"   We made it through the worst of the pandemic better than most states:   •  WITHOUT painful budget cuts,  •  WITHOUT tax increases,  •  and WITHOUT layoffs of state employees"
208,"   10  As Prepared for Delivery    Next week, I will present a budget that stays true to these principles"
209,   We will again invest in our classrooms with the expansion of Opportunity Funding
210,  We will use one-time revenue to continue the largest infrastructure program in Delaware history
211,   We have a unique opportunity to make real progress on these issues not just because of our work here in Delaware
212,  But also because of the passage of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure bill
213,"   With these investments, we’ll strengthen our economy, expand opportunity, and support families as we finally emerge from this pandemic"
214,   And we’ll do it responsibly
215,"   As most of you know, I’ve served in government now in some capacity for nearly three decades"
216,    I’ve never seen a more challenging time
217,"     As I think about the past two years, and how it fits into the long history of our great state, I can’t help but think about the recent passing of Governor Ruth Ann Minner"
218,     Governor Minner did not have an easy time leading up to being governor
219, Or during her two terms wrestling with your predecessors over a laundry list of sticky issues
220,"     One thing you could count on with Ruth Ann, though, was when she faced a political issue or policy choice, she always approached it through the lens of: how it will affect people’s everyday lives"
221,"     And another thing you could count on, was that when she made a tough call – and she had to make many – she would stand by it"
222,"      Please join me in a round of applause to pay tribute to this remarkable leader – the first woman governor of Delaware   Throughout this pandemic, I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls"
223,   I know we’ve not always agreed on every decision
224, And I respect those differences
225,    But I hope you know this
226, I have always put Delawareans first
227,"    11  As Prepared for Delivery     Since the early days of March 2020, when I wake up each morning and when I go to sleep each night, I’m thinking about the health of our people"
228, And about the businesses that employ them
229,     I know this has been a difficult time
230,     But Delawareans have proven their resilience
231,"   Every time they’ve been knocked down, they get back up"
232,"    As a result, unemployment is down"
233, Children are back in school
234, Small businesses survived
235, And we are supercharging our economy with federal resources
236,   So my message today is this: We will come through this crisis
237," And when we do, we’ll be ready as a state to move forward – together"
238,"   It is my sincere hope that when I stand before you next year, the pandemic will be firmly in the rearview mirror"
239," But the last two years have taught me that whatever happens, our state will rise to the occasion"
240,    Thank you very much
241,"   God Bless you, and God Bless our great State"

74," Sheliaka helps take care of 6 women – cooking, cleaning, making sure they take their prescribed medications and providingcompanionship, which can be just as important as medical assistance"
75, Sheliaka says she cares for the residents as if they are her own familyand seeing them smile makes her day
76," Please, Ms"
77," Sheliaka, stand so the Chamber can welcome you"
78,There are many other direct support workers like Sheliaka who understand how important their jobs are and want to stay in them
79," But atthe end of the day, they have to be able to pay their bills"
80," They deserve so much more than this modest raise, but I hope it can be a steptowards change"
81,"We are also including a $100 per month supplemental pay increase for eligible first responders, which includes law enforcement o"
82," Here in Louisiana, we need to put to rest this talk about defunding the police"
83,We can never adequately compensate the men and women who put their lives on the line for public safety
84," However, it is important that wehave the ability to recruit, train, and retain the best of the best in law enforcement"
85, They deserve it
86, And the public deserves it
87,The items Iʼve mentioned so far are recurring expenditures
88, Thus no one-time dollars are proposed to fund these investments
89,But we also have a momentous opportunity this year to commit one-time dollars to one-time expenses
90," Most notably, we are going to investin infrastructure unlike any time in our history"
91," Roads, bridges, ports, railways, water and sewage systems, orphan wells, broadband…Theyall need our attention, and with funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the American Rescue Plan, and our normal CapitalOutlay program, we will make meaningful progress on Mega-projects and deferred maintenance projects that have been sitting on a shelffor decades"
92,"  The longer it takes, the more expensive they become and the more citizens lose confidence in their elected leadership"
93,My proposal includes more than $1
94,"1 billion in funding for critical infrastructure, such as $500 million for a new Mississippi River Bridge herein Baton Rouge, an additional $100 million for the bridge in Lake Charles and $500 million for water and sewer improvements statewide"
95,These dollars are being strategically placed to best leverage federal dollars for Louisiana
96,We are all tired of the jokes about knowing youʼve entered Louisiana when the roads get bad
97, Every state is struggling to update theirinfrastructure
98," And since becoming governor, weʼve invested nearly $4"
99,"7 billion in projects, including 6,312 miles of our highways, in order tochange that narrative"
100," Weʼve made significant progress, but the funds we are receiving from the federal government will allow us to catapultbig ticket projects from talk to action"
101,"My budget proposal also dedicates $550 million in federal American Rescue Plan funding to replenish Louisianaʼs Unemployment InsuranceTrust Fund, which had been funded at historically high levels prior to the pandemic"
102, We didnʼt just pull this number out of the air
103, Thatʼswhatʼs going to be required to meet the solvency goal by September that we have in state law

108, Edwards' 2022 Regular Session Remarks | Ofﬁce of Governor John Bel EdwardsSome folks may ask why this is a priority
109, Our businesses are still recovering from the pandemic
110," If we donʼt replenish the trust fund, it willautomatically trigger an increase in taxes on all businesses in the state – big and small, which pay into the trust fund"
111, That is the last thingthey need right now
112,"This is a balanced budget that is responsible, transformational, and continues my administrationʼs practice of only using one-time dollarsfor one-time expenses"
113, Itʼs a promise I made six years ago and one that I have not deviated from
114," We are not going back to the days ofdeficits, fiscal cli"
115, And we will continue to be focused on empowering families andcommunities for the future
116,Itʼs also with a focus on the future that we are working to eliminate the digital divide – a goal I have set to accomplish by 2029
117,"In this day and age, internet is something most of us take for granted"
118," But there are too many Louisianans, especially in rural communities,who still donʼt have access, canʼt a"
119,"A strong internet structure is essential to economic competitiveness, access to healthcare, educational opportunities, and an overall betterquality of life"
120,Thatʼs why my administration worked closely with Rep
121," Deshotel last year to create the Granting Unserved Municipalities BroadbandOpportunities grant program, or GUMBO for short"
122," This program, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, will provide grants to facilitate thedeployment of broadband infrastructure, connecting more than 471,000 unserved residents in our state"
123, And weʼre just getting started
124,The rest of my legislative package is also about transforming our future for the people of our state
125,That includes ensuring that the citizens of this state are fairly represented
126," We just ended the redistricting session, an opportunity that onlycomes once every decade"
127, As Iʼve o
128, Partisanship and self-interest cannot rule the day
129, Voting is one of the most important and cherished rights and responsibilities ofALL Americans
130,"  It is disappointing and unfortunate, in my view, that the end result of the special session did not reflect what is right and fair and what isrequired by the Voting Rights Act"
131,"The current demographic makeup of our state shows that the percentage of African American population has grown over the last 10 yearsand yet, while numerous maps were filed reflecting this growth, none of these maps made it to my desk"
132," The most egregious in my view isthe Congressional map because there are half as many majority minority districts as the law, basic fairness and I believe basic math require"
133,"Therefore, I vetoed the Congressional bill"
134,"You know, the Legislature undertook 5 separate redistricting e"
135, A total of 163 districts
136, And across those 5 bills and 163 districts thereʼsnot one net new majority Black district anywhere
137, The African American voting age population in this state is 31
138,"2 percent, basically a thirdof our population"
139, And itʼs likely more because according to a recent report by the U
140,S
141," Census Bureau, the Black population wasundercounted"
142, And I donʼt believe we should need a court to tell us how to do basic math: One third of six is two
143, Our children are watching us
144," In fact, many took part in the process to make their voices heard, pleading that the right thing be done"
145," Wemust think beyond ourselves and focus on their future, the future of our state, and the place they want to continue to call home"
146,"Having personally witnessed redistricting twice now, I can say that the current process is not working"
147, That is why I am supportinglegislation to establish an independent redistricting commission to support the Legislature in reapportionment for future redistricting

195,"Kerry, Peggy, Nick, and Pastor George will you all please stand to be recognized"
196,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have got to hold insurance companies more accountable"
197,"My legislative package includes a number of bills focused on hurricane deductibles, claim transparency, enforcing insurance fraud lawsagainst bad actors, revamping the adjuster registry so that policyholders can verify their adjusters, and stopping mortgage companies fromwithholding insurance money from homeowners without good reason"
198,"Iʼm not limiting my support to only the bills in my own package, however"

206, But we can work to mitigate the impacts of climate change
207,Thatʼs why I established the Climate Initiatives Task Force and set a goal of reaching net zero by 2050
208," This taskforce, which includesscientists, academics, industry leaders and environmentalists, has adopted a Statewide Climate Action Plan"

1," And, of course, Virginia"
2, Thanks for being there for the people of Kentucky once again
3,  I am humbled to stand before you tonight to deliver my third State of the Commonwealth Address
4," In many ways, this address feels both the toughest and the most exciting"
5," We come into this New Year with excitement and optimism, with an economy booming like never before"
6," At the same time, we are all processing grief and sadness after a year of unprecedented natural disasters and a continuing pandemic"
7," We are just weeks from the deadliest tornado outbreak in state history, which took 77 lives, including one child just 6 days old"
8," Entire towns were nearly wiped off the map, leaving thousands of our brothers and sisters homeless or struggling"
9," All of this as we continue to fight a COVID pandemic that has now taken more than 12,000 of our Kentucky family, friends and neighbors and more than 828,000 of our fellow Americans"
10," But even through these trials and the pain we carry from them, I am here to report the State of our Commonwealth is strong"
11," And I am confident, even certain, that our time – Kentucky’s time – is here"
12, Our commonwealth is strong
13, It is strong because we are strong
14,"  In Kentucky, we are good people, tough people, resilient people"
15, We care deeply for one another
16," And while they may knock us down, no tornado, no pandemic, no flood, no ice storm can break us"
17, Because we do not break
18, All of America – and indeed the entire world – has now seen who we are: neighbors who open our homes and hearts to one another
19," People who embrace selflessness, generosity and love"
20," All while we were reminded that any arguments, any divisions, just aren’t that important"
21,  And not even the difficulties of our present can stop our excitement of the future
22, And good people deserve a good future
23, Our time is here
24, Kentucky is no longer a fly-over state
25, We are the destination
26,"     We are celebrating the greatest economic progress we’ve seen in our nearly 230-year history, with the largest ever private sector investment, the most new jobs and the second highest wages in state history – and we are just getting started"
27," We will talk more about this exciting time, our time"
28," But first, let’s address our trials and our tragedies"
29," 2021 was marked by the loss of far too many of our friends, family members and neighbors"
30," Everyone lost someone, maybe multiple some ones, over the last year"
31," On top of another year of painful losses to the pandemic, 2021 was bookended by natural disasters: devastating ice storms and historic flooding in January and February, and the deadly tornado outbreak in December"
32," After each of these disasters, I visited the communities that were suffering, to see the damage myself and to listen to the stories of our families"
33, I traveled to a warming center in Ashland during the ice storm
34," I found a friend of mine sitting in the corner with his dad, whose dialysis machine was plugged into the wall"
35," I watched as volunteers brought in meals, and a medical team from King’s Daughters arrived and walked family to family to make sure everyone was okay"
36," One month later, that same warming center was underwater as record flooding hit parts of Eastern Kentucky"
37," Days later, I went to Beattyville, which had been almost completely submerged"
38, I listened to one of our county judges describe an amazing helicopter rescue by our National Guard
39, Let’s take a moment to thank the National Guard for their heroic efforts this last year – I am proud to be your commander in chief
40," Months after Beattyville, I was in Nicholas County"
41," A historic flood had taken homes clear off their foundations, red Xs painted on their doors as a painful symbol that people could not return to their homes"
42," And then came December, with at least five tornados hitting on the same terrible night, one of which stayed on the ground bringing death and destruction for more than 200 miles"
43," The stories of that night are tragic, but they are also heroic"
44," I met a farmer in Taylor County who pulled multiple neighbors from the basements of their collapsed homes, clearing away enough debris to pull them out"
45, He told me one family called out: “Please don’t leave us!” And he didn’t
46," That man, Nevin Price, is with us tonight with his wife, Sherrie"
47, Let’s give him the round of applause that a hero deserves
48, Jeremy Creason couldn’t be with us tonight
49, Jeremy is chief of the Fire Department in Mayfield
50, He was among the first on the scene after a tornado leveled a candle factory with dozens of workers inside
51," I remember talking to Jeremy, the mayor and police chief just after midnight on that difficult night as they worked to save so many lives"
52," To all our first responders, the people of Kentucky thank you"
53,  2   Nothing I’d ever witnessed prepared me for the level of destruction I saw in Western Kentucky
54, One of the hardest hit places was my dad’s hometown of Dawson Springs
55," This is a place I know, a place that I love"
56," This was always a safe place for me, a place where my family sang hymns on my grandfather’s porch"
57," Miraculously, that home, that porch still stand, but just a block away everything is gone"
58," Seventeen people, from a town where bad things simply don’t happen, were lost"
59," My faith teaches me that while we struggle to understand the whys of human suffering, we can see the presence of God’s in the response"
60," Scripture (Galatians 6:2) tells us: “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ"
61,”  We saw that in the actions of our people and in the outpouring of love and support from around the world
62," People from all over, many with little or no personal connection to Kentucky, have pledged millions of dollars to help the recovery and have volunteered thousands of hours"
63," Many others – including Lieutenant Governor Coleman, folks from the executive branch and LRC– rolled up their sleeves to give blood at drives like one sponsored here at the Capitol"
64," And when the First Lady started a toy drive, gifts poured in and piled up by the hundreds of thousands to make sure these kids who had already lost so much could have a good Christmas"
65,"  Britainy, I am so proud of your work"
66, I was changed by your toy drive
67," Passing out those toys, and in visiting with those families, I had at least two special moments"
68,  One was when I joined Coach Cal and Samaritan’s Feet to hand out shoes
69, A young boy lit up as I pulled out a new pair of blue sneakers
70," He immediately asked if he could put them on right there, right then"
71," We got them on him, and he jumped up and began running around, showing pure joy in a pair of shoes… just days after devastation"
72," And then there was Kara McKnight, a special girl I met at our Christmas celebration at Pennyrile Park"
73, It had been a tough month for her and her family
74," She lost her older brother, Logan, around Thanksgiving"
75, And then she lost her house in the tornado
76," My daughter, Lila, and I volunteered to be Kara’s personal shoppers, and I started handing her more and more board games and other toys"
77," When her hands were full, I started loading Lila up with more, just for Kara"
78, And that’s when it happened
79, She began to laugh
80," An amazing, special laugh I will always remember"
81," A laugh that reminded me that even in the darkness, there is wonderful, pure, joyful light"
82," Kara, her brother, Jett, and her parents, Ashley and Jason, are with us tonight"
83," And I know Logan is here with us, too"
84, Thank you to Kara and her entire family for their strength and for their goodness
85, The courage and compassion Americans and Kentuckians have shown for one another during our plight fills me with pride at being your Governor and also with certainty that we – as Team  3  Kentucky – have what it takes to meet this challenge
86, We are committed to being there for those who lost everything in these tornadoes
87, I appreciate President Biden’s support for our people during this disaster
88, He granted my request that the federal government pay for the entire cost of the first 30 days of cleanup
89," That’s a huge help, and I have requested an extension"
90, Because there’s so much more that needs to be done
91,"  As part of that effort, I am working with House and Senate members on fast-track legislation to help our impacted families"
92, This legislation directs $150 million to help our communities rebuild
93, Another $50 million would go to the region’s schools to help them recover and get them ready to provide the best possible education to the kids there
94, It provides additional tools to bring and keep jobs in these communities
95," And it shows that we – Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, Executive and Legislative branches – will stand with these families"
96," So I want every family and community touched by these storms to know that I am with you, the General Assembly is with you, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky is with you, today, tomorrow and however long it takes"
97, We will rebuild
98," Every structure, every life"
99," Now, we cannot talk about the state of our commonwealth without addressing the ongoing COVID pandemic"
100," As I noted earlier, we’ve lost more than 12,000 of our fellow Kentuckians to this evil virus"
101," The nationwide death toll has surpassed 828,000"
102," Those are 828,000 children of God, missed and mourned by their communities and those who loved them"
103," And right now, we are seeing a severe, unprecedented escalation of cases due to a new variant we must take seriously"
104," In fact, today is the most new cases we have had in a single day during the pandemic"
105," Yet even with these concerns, I remain convinced that we can and will beat COVID, because in 2021 we gained the tools and knowledge we need for victory"
106," And in a point of pride we should all share, Kentucky and our people continued to take a leading role in this fight"
107," In late December 2020, I visited U of L Health as the very first COVID vaccines arrived, delivered by one of our very own UPS employees"
108," Later, I visited UPS Worldport; the workers there, proud Kentuckians and maybe a few misguided Hoosiers, continue to ensure these lifesaving Shots of Hope reach people here, throughout America and around the globe"
109, The testing and vaccine protocols developed here in the commonwealth with the help of partners like Kroger and Gravity Diagnostics have gone on to become national models
110," Think about, in little more than a year, we’ve built the most robust testing and vaccination networks in human history"
111," It was called the greatest logistics challenge since World War II, and we got it done"
112," In just over a year, we’ve vaccinated over 62% of every man, woman and child in the commonwealth, something that has never, ever been done before"
113," Right now, people can drive or even walk to one or multiple locations where they can receive, free of charge, COVID testing, or a vaccination, or a booster"
114, Get your booster
115,"  4  We still need many more of our people to choose to get vaccinated and boosted, but we can and should take pride in the fact that our vaccination rate has consistently been in the top three in our region and now nearly 75% of all Kentuckians 18 and older have received at least their first shot of hope"
116," My administration’s COVID response is and will always will be based on saving lives: not what is easy, not what is popular, but what is necessary and what is right"
117, That’s why we were one of the very first states to prioritize vaccinations for our educators
118, It’s how Kentucky was one of the first states to return to in-person instruction in every single school district
119, The rest of the nation later adopted our approach
120,"  And as our kids went back to in-person learning, they had the support of the First Lady’s Coverings for Kids"
121, That effort ensured that students across the commonwealth had a mask to wear to protect them as they learned
122," Individuals and businesses, including Ford Motor Company and Humana, donated more than 2-point-4 million masks"
123," Folks, COVID is our Spanish flu"
124, It is our plague
125, But we are strong enough to defeat it no matter how long it takes
126," Yes, in 2021 we faced a once-in-100-years pandemic that is the challenge of our lifetime"
127," On top of that, we have dealt with flooding, ice storms and deadly tornadoes"
128," Still, we never took our eye off the ball and worked every day to build a better future of our kids"
129," Along the way, we shattered every economic development record in the books! We attracted a record $11"
130,2 billion in private-sector investments
131," Even better, these investments will create more than 18,000 quality jobs for Kentucky families"
132,"  In September, we landed the largest single investment this state has ever seen"
133," At nearly $6 billion and 5,000 new jobs, Ford Motor Company and its partner, SK Innovation, are going to build the nation’s largest electric vehicle battery plants right here in Kentucky"
134, Bill Ford Jr
135," is Ford’s executive chair, and Henry Ford’s great-grandson"
136," He sat in my office and said, “Andy, this is the biggest step in the auto industry since the Model T"
137," And this is the biggest investment Ford has ever made, and we are making it in Kentucky"
138,” That’s when it hit me: Ford Motor Company – a company that is as American as America – was betting its future
139, And who did Ford trust enough to bet its future on? The people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
140, And it is not just Ford
141, Pratt Industries is making its largest ever investment – a half-a-billion-dollars – in Henderson
142, This is the largest project in Western Kentucky in 25 years
143,"   5  Toyota continues to believe in us, investing over $461 million in electric vehicles and adding 1,400 direct, full-time jobs"
144," GE Appliances is expanding in Louisville, showing us that U"
145,S
146, manufacturing is back
147," In October, the company announced a $450 million investment and 1,000 new jobs"
148, Amazon operationalized its new $1
149,"5 billion Air Hub, creating 2,000 jobs in Northern Kentucky"
150, Ahlstrom-Munksjo located a second facility in Madisonville with a $70 million investment that will create more than 50 jobs
151," And Fidelity Investments in Covington, which was already one of Northern Kentucky’s largest employers, announced 600 professional jobs this summer"
152, These are world-class companies choosing us; some of the most sophisticated corporations on the planet betting their future on Kentucky
153, These are the jobs of the future and they are coming to every part of our state
154,  Kentucky is leading on electric vehicles
155," Ford and Toyota’s investments were joined by Firestone Industrial Products, creating 250 jobs in Whitley County"
156," We, Kentucky, are leading in agritech, with AppHarvest announcing four expansions in Morehead, Somerset, Berea and Richmond"
157," AppleAtcha, who is growing apples on abandoned coal mine property, is expected to create 2,000 full-time jobs in Inez"
158, AppleAtchah’s own Bernie Kosar – Super Bowl and national champion quarterback – is here with us tonight
159, Thank you Bernie for the work you all are doing to fuel our agritech industry and feed our people
160, Fresh Harvest continues to grow in Stanford and Enviroflight is thriving in Maysville
161," Other high-tech companies have made great strides, including Rajant in Morehead, which expanded its mesh telecommunications system, and Novelis, which opened its first new facility since 1982 investing over $300 million in Todd County"
162," Kentucky was already the worldwide leader in bourbon production, but in 2021 we saw the industry continue to expand, both in production and tourism"
163, We welcomed revivals like the Dant Family and Log Still
164, We celebrated exciting new players like Horse Soldier Bourbon in Somerset
165, These folks are the real deal
166," American heroes that, again, chose us"
167, They are investing hundreds of millions of dollars in Southern Kentucky to build something really special
168, We also applauded as stalwarts like Four Roses and Heaven Hill for cutting ribbons on expanded visitor centers
169," And I must say a special personal thank you to Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, whom I personally worked with to remove harmful bourbon tariffs and ensure a bright future for a signature industry"
170," As you can see, the incredible economic leaps we are taking aren’t confined to just a few counties or a few cities"
171," And my pledge is that everyone will share in the coming prosperity, especially the regions and the neighborhoods that are far too often left out"
172,  6  Let me give you one of my favorite examples
173," A month and a half ago, I returned to Beattyville"
174," This time, it was not to respond to a natural disaster, but to welcome LION First Responder back to the community"
175," LION, which reopened its PPE manufacturing in the community; and it did so in the same building the company left in 2010"
176," What I saw that day was not just hope, it was progress; it was a step toward prosperity"
177, Here with us tonight representing LION are Diane Best and Patty Barker
178, Let’s thank them for investing in our Kentucky communities
179," So after a record year – one where we won, and we won, and we won some more – where do we go? The answer should be simple: forward"
180," With all that we have experienced this year, we should be over the fighting, over the bickering, over any games"
181,"  After this year, I am convinced that our role in government is not to move the state right or left, but to move it forward"
182," So this year, and in this session, we have a duty – a responsibility – to make the investments that can turn two years of great progress into 20 years of real prosperity"
183," In a little over a week, I will join you again to unveil a budget that does just that"
184,  I believe a budget is more than lines and numbers
185," It’s a values statement, and my upcoming budget will reflect our Kentucky values of family, faith, community and a deep compassion for our neighbors"
186," It will make historic investments in education, as world-class companies require a world-class workforce"
187," It will create a fund for investing in development sites, so that we attract the next Ford or Toyota"
188," It will invest in essential workers, like our Kentucky State Police, our nurses and our teachers, to ensure we can not only recruit, but retain these critical jobs"
189, It will ensure we remain a leader in agriculture technology in Eastern Kentucky and will build on our pharmaceutical footprint in Northern Kentucky
190, It will continue to deliver on our promise of a world-class airport in Paducah
191," It will continue to invest in infrastructure, with more water and sewer grants"
192, And we will continue to expand the Mountain Parkway to four lanes and construct the I-69 bridge
193, It will move us ever closer to the announcement – which I hope we can make next year – that we will construct a Brent Spence Companion bridge without tolls
194, And it will include a raise for all of our state workers
195," We simply cannot say that we respect and support our teachers, social workers and other state workers while removing their pensions and not providing them a raise in over a decade"
196, And I care enough for each and every one of them to get them closer to paying them what they are worth
197,"  7  Folks our time is here, and our future is now"
198, But for us to achieve our destiny we have to embrace it and work for it
199, President Abraham Lincoln a hero to this state and this country said it best: “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today
200,"” As representatives of the people of Kentucky, we are called at this crucial moment in our history to accept this great responsibility and to lead"
201, I know we can agree to work together to rebuild and recover
202, I know we can take the bold actions needed to move us forward
203,"  If we choose to act wisely, maybe if we choose to act kindly, then we can look back decades from now and see that it was this moment, right here, that made all the difference"
204," After standing in what used to be downtown Mayfield, after walking through what used to be Dawson Springs, after seeing the devastation of Bremen, I think we should all be changed people"
205, So let’s spend this legislative session focused on bettering the lives of our people
206, Let’s focus on restoring and repairing lives and buildings in Western Kentucky
207, Let’s focus on reducing the number of children or seniors who go to bed hungry each night
208, Let’s focus on bringing healing and recovery to those struggling with opioid and other addiction issues
209, Let’s focus on making sure our children are getting the very best education
210, Let’s work together to support our workforce to fill all the jobs coming our way
211, Let’s make sure that our incredible economic momentum reaches every corner of the commonwealth and every neighborhood in all of our cities
212," And let’s not devolve into anger, division, bitterness or hate ever again"
213, We’ve been called to be better people
214, And we should be
215," Scripture further guides us: “Let us not become weary of doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up"
216,” We are too strong to give up
217, We must go forward
218, Our time is here; our future is now
219, God bless and God bless the Commonwealth of Kentucky
220, Thank you

0,"2022 State of the State Address“Changing Maryland for the Better”As Prepared for DeliveryWednesday, February 2, 2022Maryland State House, AnnapolisMy fellow Marylanders:I’m speaking to you tonight from the Old Senate Chamber of our historic State House in Annapolis"
1,"It was in this very chamber that General George Washington relinquished his command of the ContinentalForces, laying the foundation for a new republic with the first peaceful transition of power in our history"
2,"238 years ago, the Revolutionary War ended right here, in this very room, with the ratification of theTreaty of Paris"
3,"For Maryland and for our nation, this is a place where great things begin and where great things areaccomplished, and it is from this hallowed place that I have the privilege to report to you on the state ofour state"
4,What makes the state of our state strong is the caliber and character of our people
5,"Earlier today, we laid to rest three of our true heroes of the Baltimore City Fire Department who tragicallydied in the line of duty—Lt"
6," Paul Butrim, Lt"
7," Kelsey Sadler, and Firefighter Kenny Lacayo"
8,Far too often our first responders don’t get the appreciation they deserve
9," It shouldn't take a tragedy likethis to remind us of the tremendous debt we owe to all of our firefighters, police, and first responders"
10,"In memory of Kenny, Kelsey, and Paul, I ask for all the people of Maryland to find a way to say thank youto those who run toward the danger as others run from it"
11,"It has now been seven years since you first granted me the honor of serving as Maryland’s governor, andthere has not been a single day—good or bad—when I was not grateful for the privilege"
12,I’ll never forget that snowy day when I stood on the steps of this State House to be inaugurated as the62nd governor of Maryland
13,I spoke about the wedge politics and petty rhetoric being used to belittle adversaries and to inflamepartisan divisions in America
14,I vowed that day that the politics that have divided our nation need not divide our state
15,"And I pledged to create an environment of trust and cooperation where the best ideas rise to the topbased upon their merit, regardless of which side of the aisle they come from"
16,"I pledged to bring fiscal responsibility and common sense to our state capital, to make Maryland morecompetitive and our state government more responsive, to provide tax relief for families, smallbusinesses, and retirees, to improve education for Maryland’s children, to protect our environment, and torebuild our crumbling infrastructure"
17,"Our mission was to change Maryland for the better, and tonight, I’m proud to report that we have doneexactly what we said we would do, and because of that, the state of our state is strong—by any measure,stronger and better than it was when we began our mission"
18,"Together, we have changed Maryland for the better by facing our fiscal challenges head-on, easing thetax burden, and paving the way for historic economic growth and record job creation"
19,We changed Maryland for the better with record investments in education eight years in a row to prepareour children for the opportunities of the future
20,We changed Maryland for the better by protecting the health care coverage of Marylanders and providinglower insurance rates for the first time in a decade
21,"We changed Maryland for the better with historic funding for Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, ProgramOpen Space, and other land preservation programs, and by setting bold goals to reduce greenhouse gasemissions"
22,"We changed Maryland for the better with record investments in our roads, bridges, and transit systems,transformative projects to relieve some of the worst traffic congestion in America and to expandcapabilities at the Port of Baltimore and BWI Marshall Airport, along with historic investment to ensureuniversal high-speed internet access to everyone in every corner of the state"
23,We have been able to accomplish these things despite some formidable and unforeseen challenges
24,"None of us could have imagined how we would all be tested by a once-in-a-century global pandemic andthe unprecedented turmoil it caused—the lives and livelihoods lost, the unimaginable personal andeconomic hardship"
25,We stepped up and rose to the challenge by bringing to bear the entire arsenal of government and publichealth
26,"We mobilized the citizen soldiers of the Maryland National Guard to lead strike forces into nursing homesto save the lives of our most vulnerable, to stand up surge tents at hospitals, to transport life-savingequipment, and to administer tests and vaccines"
27,"When no state in America had any testing capacity whatsoever, we led by building an entire testinginfrastructure from scratch"
28,"When hospitals were overflowing, we added 6,000 additional surge beds and stood up new fieldhospitals"
29,"When we needed to reinforce our beleaguered health care workforce and emergency personnel, weactivated the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps and called retired nurses and nursing studentsinto action"
30,We built mass testing and vaccination sites all across the state and established the nation’s first VaccineEquity Task Force to get shots into arms in hard to reach and underserved communities
31,"Together, we have led one of the strongest health and economic recoveries in America thanks to theheroics of our health care workers, our emergency services personnel, National Guard soldiers andairmen, and the resilience of our small business community and all the people of our state who cametogether, looked out for one another, and who answered the call to be ‘Maryland Strong"
32,"’We have now spent nearly two years fighting this virus and it has taken far too much from us, including,sadly, 13,316 of our fellow Marylanders"
33,"But tonight there is hope, because with swift and decisive actions and the vigilance of Marylanders, I’mpleased to report that we have turned back another dangerous variant of COVID-19, and tomorrow, thestate of emergency will end in Maryland"
34,Our long-term public health response will continue
35," Our surge capacity, our testing and tracing operations,our vaccine clinics—all those things will remain in place as part of the ongoing operations of government"
36,"But my message to you tonight is that we must all learn to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it"
37,We can’t let it continue to dictate how we live our lives
38,Our offices and businesses need to be open
39," Our kids need to be in school, in-person"
40,"Of course we will continue to follow the data and the science, and we’ll keep fighting back with everythingwe’ve got"
41," But make no mistake about it, we are moving forward full speed ahead, and we will continue tolead the nation in both health and economic recovery"
42,We are also going to finish the job we set out to do back in 2015
43,"We’re going to keep changing Maryland for the better by passing more much-needed tax cuts forhardworking families, small businesses, and retirees"
44," And fortunately, we are now in a  position to do justthat"
45,"After seven years of fiscal discipline and responsible budgetary actions, record job creation and economicgrowth, together we successfully brought our economy back from the brink—from the 43 consecutive taxhikes that took $10 billion from the pockets of struggling families, small businesses, and retirees; fromlosing 8,000 businesses and over 100,000 jobs; and from the crushing $5"
46,1 billion structural deficit weinherited
47,"We repealed the Rain Tax mandate and eliminated or reformed more than 14,000 job-killing regulations"
48,We cut tolls at every single facility in the state—the first time tolls had been cut in Maryland in 50 years
49,"We passed the RELIEF Act of 2021—the largest tax cut in state history—nearly unanimously, whichprovided $1"
50,45 billion in urgently needed tax relief and economic stimulus
51," We have now cut taxes, tolls,and fees seven years in a row by more than $2"
52,7 billion
53,"We changed the mission of state government to be unabashedly pro-jobs and pro-business, and weexperienced the biggest economic turnaround in America"
54,"We launched innovative initiatives, like More Jobs for Marylanders, which helped us go from 50th inAmerica in manufacturing to adding more manufacturing jobs than 39 other states"
55,"In spite of all the pressures of COVID-19, inflation, and the supply chain crisis, we were able to keep mostof our economy open throughout the entire crisis"
56,"As a result, our economic recovery is one of the very best in America, our unemployment rate is thelowest it’s been since before the pandemic, and a national survey named Maryland as the most improvedstate for business in America"
57,"Not only have we submitted balanced budgets every year, but for the first time in nearly a quarter century,the State of Maryland is projecting a long-term structurally balanced budget well into the future, includinga $2"
58,5 billion surplus—the largest ever in state history—and we put a record $3
59,6 billion of savings intoour Rainy Day Fund
60,Our fiscal health and our economy are stronger than they have been in decades
61, But changing Marylandfor the better means continuing to help the working families and seniors on fixed income who are gettingsqueezed by inflation and higher costs
62,"So we introduced the largest tax cut package in Maryland history, more than $4"
63,6 billion in additionalmuch-needed tax reductions
64,Our state’s sky-high retirement taxes remain the one area where we are still not effectively competingwith other states
65," Over the course of our administration we have been successful in passing targetedretirement tax relief for our military retirees and for our hometown heroes, our law enforcement, fire andrescue, corrections, and emergency personnel"
66, But that’s not enough
67,"The time has come for the General Assembly to finally pass the Retirement Tax Elimination Act toeliminate every single penny of state retirement taxes for everyone, so that Marylanders who have spenttheir lives working and raising a family here, and contributing so much to our state, can afford to retirehere in Maryland near their kids and grandkids"
68,"Each year when I have proposed critical tax relief for seniors, legislators have said we just can’t afford it"
69,"Well, with our economy booming and our fiscal health stronger than ever before, we can’t afford not to doit"
70,Our tax reduction package includes $650 million more in tax cuts for hardworking families
71," And to help oursmall businesses continue to grow, we’re eliminating even more costly fees and red tape"
72,"And we’re proposing legislation to codify Project Restore and to make it permanent, to incentivize newbusiness growth and to create even more jobs in downtowns, on Main Streets, and in communities allacross our state"
73,And we’re going to enact the More Jobs for Marylanders Act 3
74,"0, a successful program we first enacted in2017 and then expanded in 2019, which incentivizes and encourages the creation of more jobs where weneed them most"
75,Changing Maryland for the better also means finally enacting our legislation to combat violent crime
76,Baltimore City once again ended last year with more than 300 homicides
77," Among the victims were moreyoung teenagers caught in the crossfire of gang violence, along with 69-year-old Evelyn Player, who wasstabbed to death at her church, and Baltimore City Police Officer Keona Holley, who was ambushed andexecuted in her patrol car"
78,"On the very first day of the new year, a 16- and a 17-year-old were gunned down in a triple shooting,becoming the first victims of 2022"
79,"Just last week, Cheryl McCormack, a 51-year-old grandmother who was working as a DoorDash driver,was gunned down during a robbery in northeast Baltimore, and Chelsey Patterson, the general managerof a popular restaurant in Little Italy, was fatally shot in Fells Point"
80,It was the deadliest January in the city in nearly 50 years
81,"The reality is, no matter how much money we invest or what state actions we take, Baltimore City will notever get control of the violence if they can’t arrest more, prosecute more, and sentence more of the mostviolent criminals to get them off the streets"
82,"The people of Baltimore deserve results from their city leaders and legislators, not more empty platitudesand broken promises"
83,"Year after year, we have introduced tough anti-violent crime legislation that is supported by more than80% of the people of Baltimore and more than 80% of every demographic, everywhere, all across thestate"
84, But those pleas for action have repeatedly been ignored
85,Enough is enough
86, The time has come for Baltimore City to take back its streets and communities onceand for all
87,"Tonight, on behalf of all the people who are sick and tired of all of the senseless violence, I’m calling onthe leaders in both parties, in both houses, to immediately pass and send to my desk the Violent FirearmsOffender Act to increase penalties for those who use guns to commit violent crimes, and the JudicialTransparency Act, because the public has a right to know about the sentences judges are giving or notgiving to the most violent offenders"
88,People are being shot and are dying nearly every single day
89, It’s time to put the politics aside and tofinally get this done
90, There can be no more excuses
91,Homicides and violent crime waves are surging in nearly every major city all across the country
92, And theviolence terrorizing our neighborhoods and cities is made worse by divisive politics and the demonizationof the dedicated men and women who risk their lives every day to keep us safe
93,Law enforcement agencies in Maryland and across the nation are struggling to attract and retain qualifiedofficers
94, There could not possibly be a worse time for anyone to call for defunding the police or for cuttingfunding for public safety
95,"The reality is that our police are underfunded and under attack, which is why we launched a half a billiondollar Re-Fund The Police Initiative to help recruit and retain more quality officers, to increase diversityand expand community policing efforts, to improve training to teach better de-escalation techniques, andto provide body cams and other technology and equipment upgrades for state and local policedepartments all across Maryland"
96,"Since we announced our Re-Fund The Police Initiative, many cities and states have begun to follow ourlead"
97," Even some of the most progressive cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, are nowagreeing that we need more investment in public safety"
98,"Time and again our police, our firefighters, and first responders bravely answer the call, and as long asI'm governor, I will continue to stand with them and continue to fight to provide them with the support andthe resources they need to keep our communities safe"
99,Our nation is bitterly divided
100, We need to find a way to fix the broken and toxic politics that is tearing usapart
101,"We need to restore trust and fairness to our political system by allowing voters to pick their electedrepresentatives, rather than having politicians pick their voters"
102,Gerrymandering is partisanship at its worst
103," It’s a cancer on our democracy, and Maryland has theunfortunate distinction of having the worst, most gerrymandered districts in America"
104,Maryland legislators had the chance to right that wrong
105,"We introduced fair maps, which were created by Maryland’s nonpartisan Citizens RedistrictingCommission"
106," But legislators replaced them with maps that they drew up in secret, behind closed doors,which have been universally criticized, receiving a flunking ‘F’ grade by the Princeton GerrymanderingProject"
107,These maps make a mockery of our democracy
108," Fortunately, the courts—not the legislature—will be thefinal arbiter"
109,"In his farewell address, George Washington warned that partisanship would create a ‘spirit of revenge’that would undermine the ‘reins of government’ and lead to the ‘ruins of public liberty"
110,"’My fellow Marylanders, in this historic place where the founding principles of American democracy wereborn, and here in our great state where Francis Scott Key wrote of a flag that was still there, whereFrederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman forged the path to freedom, where Thurgood Marshall fought forequal justice under law, we still believe in the power of coming together to change things for the better,and we still believe that what unites us is greater than that which divides us"
111,"To those who say that America is too divided, that our political system is too broken and can’t be fixed, Iwould argue that we have already shown a better path forward"
112,"And if we can accomplish that here in Maryland, then there is no place in America where these very sameprinciples cannot succeed"
113,"So tonight, as we reflect on all that we have accomplished together, and as we embark on the hard workstill left to be done, I want to once again say thank you to the people of Maryland for giving me thisincredible honor of serving as your governor"
114,"This truly is the most important work of my life, and I pledge to you that I am going to keep giving this jobeverything I’ve got, every single day that I am given"
115,Let’s finish the work we started together
116,"Let’s keep changing Maryland for the better, and let’s continue to set an example for the rest of the nation,so that America can once again be a shining example to the world"
117,May God bless the great State of Maryland and the United States of America

5,  Our state Constitution deems today the day on which I come to report to you on the state of our state
6,  That accounting is clear
7, The state of our state is resilient and ready to keep moving forward
8,   Because this is who we are as New Jerseyans
9, We believe in ourselves and we believe in each other
10,  And we know nothing is beyond our reach because nothing is beyond our willingness to work hard
11,"  Under our state Constitution, I will also have the privilege of returning here in one week’s time to rea"
12,  I am extraordinarily honored and humbled by the responsibility you have given me
13, And I am excited by thepossibilities that lay ahead for our state
14,"  And, if that’s not enough, I will be back six weeks after that to propose my budget for the upcoming "
15,"  So, over the next two months, and, indeed, the next four years, we’re going to see a lot of each other"
16, I will do my bestto not wear out my welcome
17,  We begin 2022 just as we did 2021
18,   I’m once again addressing you from an empty theater
19,   And our state remains on a war footing against a virus that has now taken on a form that is overwhelming ourcollective psyche as it tests our state
20,  We’re all frustrated by this pandemic
21,  We’re all tired of it getting in the way of everything we do
22,  We’re all ready to get on with our lives
23, And I am committed to seeing us get there …   Back to top… To schools where our kids’ smiles once again light up hallways and classrooms
24,  … To Main Street stores and restaurants where communities can once again come alive
25,  … To sports arenas where cheers are once again heard loudly and clearly
26,"  … To living rooms where we can once again freely gather with family and friends, whether for a holiday, a birthday, orjust on the spur of the moment"
27,    … And to workplaces that are again fully safe and humming with the promise of a prosperous future
28,"  It has, indeed, been an extraordinarily long two years"
29,"  Yet, as inconvenient as life is for so many of us, it pales in comparison to what some have been through"
30,    We will never forget the loss that has hit so many of our neighbors
31,"  And we will forever honor the tremendous hard work and dedication of all of the women and men working on thefront lines – especially the doctors, nurses, and staff across our entire health-care system"
32,"  Hard work, even in the face of great challenge, does not deter us as New Jerseyans"
33," Hard work, especially in the faceof great challenge, de"
34,   Just as we thought we had 
35,   Omicron is doing its best to stop us in our tracks and push us back
36, We will not let it
37,   We are seeing new case counts that dwarf anything we’d seen to this point – upwards of four times as many NewJerseyans have COVID today than did one year ago
38, Thirty thousand new cases a day
39, More new cases day-to-daythan even at the pandemic’s start
40,"   Even the knowledge that illness from Omicron can be less severe is of little solace, as these tremendous numbers ofcases – even with the lower percentage chance of hospitalization that comes with them – mean that we have morepeople in our hospitals today than at any point since the spring of 2020"
41,  And it means that more of our fellow New Jerseyans are leaving us all too soon
42,"  In consultation with my partners in the Legislature, I have taken the necessary step of re-declaring a Public HealthEmergency to ensure we keep moving forward – guided by facts and science – and that we keep doing everything wecan to beat back Omicron and put COVID behind us"
43,"  In your day-to-day lives, this step won’t bring any changes"
44," But it is vital to ensuring our continued and coordinatedresponse so we can move forward and put COVID behind us …  … A response that keeps our schools, businesses, and economy open, and allows us to get back to a real and lastingsense of normal"
45,  … A response that ensures critical testing supplies and vaccines can be distributed to communities where they aremost needed and given to the residents who most need them
46,  … A response that protects the ability of our hospitals to care for the hundreds of New Jerseyans entering thembecause of COVID every day
47,  … A response that ensures we are getting the data we need from across our health-care system to make smart andforward-looking decisions
48,"  … A response that keeps state, county, and local health authorities working together"
49,"    Back to top… And a response that ensures we keep following science and fact, and not politics, so we can keep moving forward"
50,  We are all in this together
51, And we must keep moving forward together
52,"  But try as it may to knock us back and further divide us, one thing is certain"
53, Omicron has not knocked us down
54," In fact, despite all the challenges, we continue to move New Jersey forward"
55,"  Across New Jersey, nearly 90 percent of all eligible residents have received at least a "
56, Let me saythat again – nine out of every ten eligible residents have now raised up their sleeve at least once
57, And 75 percent ofyou have completed your primary vaccination course
58,  But we know that these initial courses – either the two-dose regimen of the P
59, It is more important than ever that you get your booster shot
60,  Science and reality tell us that what we once called “full” vaccination is no longer that
61, A booster is not a bonus – it isa necessity
62,"   So, if you have not yet gotten your booster shot, here is what I ask of you – go get it"
63, The booster is proven to lessenthe impact of illness to keep you out of the hospital
64,   And every vaccine dose is a ray of light through the dark cloud that has hung over our families
65, Every dose gets usone step closer to regaining the life we knew prior to COVID
66,"  To each and every one of you who have done the right things – worn your masks even when you didn’t want to, foundor made time to get your boosters, and taken precautions even when it meant postponing precious familycelebrations – Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver and I thank you from the very bottom of our hearts"
67,  And so do so many millions of your fellow New Jerseyans who have done the very same
68,"  Across the nation, we’ve seen some of the worst that crises can bring out in people"
69, The sel
70, The public shaming and 
71, The deliberate misinformation
72,  We’ve seen some of this in New Jersey
73," But, to be sure, it’s a small minority"
74,"   There are far, far many more of you who have done the hard work and proven our state’s overwhelming sel"
75, You’ve proven our collective faith in science and facts and medicine – and in each other
76,"   Our state has become a beacon of what’s possible when we rise to face a challenge together with fearless optimism,and not use it to cynically drive people apart"
77,"   And if we hold together to shine bright just a little longer, we will disperse the dark cloud of COVID"
78,  We may not have yet fully conquered the virus
79, But we will never let the virus conquer us
80,   We must get to the point where we stay in front of it and don’t fall back again
81, And we will
82,"  And even with the pandemic hanging over our work across the past two years, working together over the past four wehave accomplished much – and there is much for us to take pride in and talk about"
83,   We inherited a state that worked for too few and which was at a crossroads
84, We chose to move the state in a newdirection
85, We are moving New Jersey forward
86,"  Today, New Jersey is working again for the many, not the few"
87,   We have greater tax fairness
88," We’ve cut taxes for our middle-class and working families, and our seniors, fourteentimes"
89, And I commit to you now that the state budget I propose in a few weeks won’t raise taxes
90,"  We have more accessible and affordable health care and child care, stronger public schools, and more affordablehigher education"
91,   Back to topOur economy is growing again
92, Across the nine years before I took o
93," Today, we rank fourth"
94, From 47th to fourth
95, That’s real progress despite all we’ve been through andall we still face
96,  Our state is growing again
97," For years, we were fed a line that no one wanted to be part of our New Jersey family"
98, Butthe truth is the exact opposite
99, Our population is growing
100, Our real estate market is strong
101,  And we’re making more progress against property taxes than any administration before us
102," Through the policieswe’ve put in place, and the community investments we’ve made, our administration has slowed the rate of propertytax growth more than any of the previous four administrations – a record that includes four of the lowest year-over-year increases in property taxes on record"
103,  The reality is this – we’re making New Jersey the place where businesses want to locate and families want to live
104,"The Census counts it in black-and-white – while some states in our region lost population, New Jersey grew"
105,  The moving vans are driving into New Jersey
106,  In any number of issues which are national in scope …   … Combating senseless gun violence …  … Protecting the fundamental right to reproductive freedom …  … Facing the existential crisis of climate change …  … Ensuring that every newborn and every new family have a healthy start …  … Repairing a broken criminal justice system …  … Standing 
107,"  And New Jersey – yes, New Jersey – is ranked as the best state in which to live for our safe communities, educationsystem, health care, and quality of life"
108, We are the number one state in America to raise a family
109,  We are a model that others now seek to emulate
110,  We have achieved these accomplishments during the most di
111," And because we all know that these times are not yet over, neither is the work we are prepared toundertake in this new year"
112,"  Over the course of the past two years, nothing has been as important to our state than the health of our families andfriends"
113," But we know the cost of health care remains a critical worry for many – and too many families are one illnessaway, or one high-cost prescription away, from "
114,   But we are making high-quality health care both more affordable and more accessible
115,  Since our administration took o
116,"   And for 2022, enrollment in health insurance through our individual marketplace is up 25 percent over last year"
117,"  So, here’s what this means – more people have insurance and they’re paying less for it"
118,   Back to topAnd this upcoming year we will continue to directly take on increasing costs to make health care more affordable andaccessible
119,"  A few weeks ago, I initiated a new program to help us in this effort"
120,   It started by working with hospitals and insurers to secure a commitment to limit the growth in health care costsacross the next 
121,"   And it will continue by, for the "
122,  I will also send the Legislature a plan to address prescription-drug affordability – from life-saving medications to thepills millions of residents take every day to maintain their health
123," This effort will be centered on making pricing acrossthe entire supply chain more transparent, so we can see what drives drug prices higher, and so we can lower them"
124,"   Lower costs will save families hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars a year"
125," But, across the programs our stateadministers – from Medicaid and FamilyCare for low-income families, to PAAD and Senior Gold for older residents –lower costs can save us, and you, untold millions in tax dollars"
126,"  Containing and lowering health care and prescription drug costs isn’t just good for your family’s health and bottomline, it’s also good for our state’s"
127,   And this is the year where we will see one of our most innovative plans for economic growth take hold
128, Ourgroundbreaking new public-private partnership – the Innovation Evergreen Fund – will get to work pairing both publicand private investment to support the next generation of leading-edge technology startup businesses
129,"  In 2021, leading businesses from throughout the innovation economy announced their decision to move or grow inNew Jersey, decisions that will create thousands of good jobs"
130," But we don’t want New Jersey to just be a place wherebusinesses move to, we want to be the place where they are born and grow"
131, The Innovation Evergreen Fund will becritical to making this goal our reality
132,"  As I noted, we moved from 47th to fourth in the nation in economic growth"
133," Our smart and focused effort to reclaimour historic place as the world’s most innovative economy is one of the major drivers of this, and will continue to be"
134,"  And while we take on these new initiatives, we also have some un"
135,  I thank and congratulate the Legislature on passing and sending to my desk a bill that will secure a woman’s accessto reproductive care and her right to choose into state law
136," These decisions must be kept between a woman and herdoctor, period"
137,   I will sign this into law this week
138," And I am especially proud that we are getting this done before the United StatesSupreme Court renders its ruling challenging Roe v Wade, which it is poised to overturn"
139,  And I urge the Legislature to once again take up the next phase of commonsense and comprehensive gun-safetyreforms
140," We cannot go another year without closing dangerous loopholes, requiring safety education for would-begun buyers, giving law enforcement new tools to go after criminals, and banning super-high-caliber weapons whichhave no place in the woods for hunting, let alone on our streets"
141,"  Over the next six-or-so weeks, our administration will continue undertaking the work of crafting our proposal for theFiscal 2023 state budget"
142, That document is where the vision we set today is brought not just into relief but brought tolife
143,"  We will continue to focus on a broad-based economic recovery that works for everyone, not just a lucky few"
144,  We will continue to focus on making New Jersey more affordable for everyone
145,  We will continue seeking fairness for our middle-class taxpayers and working families and seniors to deliver for themwith concrete bene
146," As I mentioned, the budget I put Back forward won’t come with any tax increases"
147,  to topAnd we will continue our work taking on the one issue that has stood in the way of too many New Jersey families forfar too long – property taxes
148,    Getting these things done will require hard work but is not insurmountable
149," I know it isn’t because we just completeda four-year cycle where we made possible what so many, for so long, had said was impossible in Trenton"
150,  The very 
151,
152,
153,  … to create opportunity for our middle-class and our working families …  … and to ensure fairness for our seniors and the next up-and-coming generation looking for their toehold in theAmerican Dream
154,"  And, of course, over the past two years, in particular, we’ve undertaken the hard work to pull our state back fromunder the cloud of a global pandemic"
155,"   And because of the hard work we’ve already put in to build a more resilient and more affordable New Jersey, we startthe next four years of our journey together in a better place"
156,"   For example, before the pandemic, we saw our state achieve the lowest sustained levels of unemployment since thestate began keeping records of unemployment"
157," The pandemic put some of this progress on pause but, every day,more New Jerseyans are now getting back to work in jobs that pay better, have better bene"
158,"  Many of our residents are getting back to work because of our direct and critical investments in tens of thousands ofsmall businesses – $800 million for retail stores, restaurants, arts and cultural institutions, child care providers, andmore – to ensure their survival through some very dark times"
159,"   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we’re keeping that backbone strong"
160,   Many others are getting jobs in the new high-tech and innovative industries we have brought to our state and thosewhich are taking root here
161,  They’re 
162,"   They are going to work in the construction trades … from the South Jersey Wind Port rising in Salem County to thePaulsboro Marine Terminal, where we will create more than 1,500 new jobs to secure our place as a global leader inoffshore-wind component manufacturing and logistics … to The Hub in New Brunswick, where doctors andresearchers will work side-by-side on the next generation of lifesaving treatments"
163,  Many jobs await in the cannabis industry ready to take off
164,  New businesses and jobs are being created because we restored common sense and fairness to our system of taxincentives
165," Some are coming because we’re not afraid to run with new ideas for attracting businesses, like theInnovation Evergreen Fund"
166,  Some are coming from a long-overdue sense of fairness and justice – values we know resonate around corporateboard tables just as they do around kitchen tables
167,"  Others, however, are coming to New Jersey because they know that right here is where they will "
168,  Education is a critical piece of this puzzle
169, Our best-in-the-nation public education system and world-class colleges Back and universities turn out the best-trained and best-educated workforce in America
170, Businesses that come here do soto topbecause they know we have a nearly bottomless well of talent from which they can draw
171,"  We are not just restoring, but creating, real opportunity for our young people to stay here and start a career to supporta family …  … Opportunity for those currently in the workforce to build a new career …  … Opportunities for entrepreneurs to maximize their investment and prosper "
172,
173,
174,   … And opportunity to make New Jersey the launchpad for the next great idea and the home of the next generation
175,  We have shown you can make economic progress and social progress at the same time
176, In fact one helps the other
177,"   The proof? As I have mentioned, we’ve jumped 43 spots in economic growth among states – from 47th when I tooko"
178,  This is exactly what stronger and fairer looks like
179, This is what creating opportunity looks like
180, This is what buildingan economy that works for every family looks like
181,"  So many of you across the state – state legislators, county and local o"
182,"  For that I say, “thank you"
183,"” And, I also say, “let’s keep it up"
184,”  But we also know there are many who do not yet feel your place is secure in this progress
185, And it is you to whom Irecommit my efforts
186,  Your place is set
187, Your seat is here
188,"  When we began our work in January 2018, our state was stagnant and seemingly broken"
189," The status quo worked fora few but left out the broad majority of New Jerseyans – hardworking New Jerseyans who didn’t want specialtreatment, just a fair shot at a better future for themselves and their families"
190,  We leveled the playing 
191,  And let me make one thing very clear
192," I do not begrudge, for one second, anyone their success"
193, I do not begrudgeanyone the realization of their American Dream
194,"  However, the price for having an unlimited upside cannot be an unlimited downside"
195, New Jersey will never moveforward if we cling to the outdated and sel
196,”  The pandemic is an example of how we are in this together
197," Millions of New Jerseyans, working sel"
198,"  Four years ago, today, New Jersey’s minimum wage was $8"
199,65 an hour – a wage that locked countless hard-workingNew Jersey families into a cycle of poverty
200," Today, our minimum wage is $13 an hour and on a path to $15 an hour,with hundreds of thousands of families now starting to reach up and pull themselves into the middle class"
201,  Here is an obvious truth some still try to deny – one meaningful way to make New Jersey more affordable is to makesure more New Jerseyans have a living wage
202, And we are on that path
203,"  Moreover, we are seeing wages increasing across the state and are now trending higher than before the pandemic"
204,"This means that as our people get back to work, they are getting back to jobs that pay better"
205, That is yet another waywe are building opportunity for more New Jersey families
206,"   Back Four years ago, our schools and property taxpayers were reeling after eight years of diminished investment"
207," We got toto topwork investing in our communities by investing in our public schools, from pre-K all the way through to graduation"
208,"  Today, New Jersey’s public education system is ranked the very best in the nation and we continue to bring more andmore students and communities under that banner"
209,  We invested $3 billion more in our public schools across our 
210," This year alone, we are investing $1"
211,5 billion more in pre-K-through-12 education than in the year I tooko
212,"  We are doing this not just because our kids deserve it but because our property taxpayers do, too"
213, School funding isproperty tax relief
214,   Every single one of these dollars we as a state have invested is a dollar kept in the pockets of property taxpayers –whether it be state aid supporting our students and educators in their classrooms or construction aid to build orrenovate schools to serve a 21st century education
215,  Strong public schools make communities more attractive for families looking to move to New Jersey
216,"  For so many of you, your home is your single greatest investment"
217, Few public investments will protect the value ofyour home more than strong and properly funded public schools
218,   But tackling property taxes goes far beyond just properly funding our schools
219," And here, too, we’ve made realprogress"
220,"  When the federal government cut your state and local tax deduction, which I continue to work to restore, weexpanded the property tax deduction allowed in your state income tax "
221,  We expanded eligibility of older homeowners for the Senior Freeze program to protect you against any property taxincreases
222,"  We modernized the Homestead Property Tax Rebate and, this past year, we delivered tax rebates of up to $500 tonearly 700,000 middle-class families"
223,  We extended property tax deductions for veterans and service-members
224,  We have also made in-state tuition payments and investments in college savings plans tax deductible
225,  We put into law the state’s 
226,"  Each of these steps is making our state more affordable and giving middle-class and working families, and seniors,the tax breaks you all deserve"
227,"  I’ll repeat our record on this …  … The slowest rate of property tax growth than during any of the previous four administrations and four of the lowestyear-over-year increases in property taxes on record …   … And fourteen middle-class tax cuts, made possible only through a commitment to fairness"
228,  And we’ve done so much more
229," I’ve noted our work to lower health care costs, particularly for those with children"
230,   We’ve put a college education within reach with our tuition-free community college program
231,  And we invested in our child-care providers to make this critical service more accessible for families getting back towork
232,  This is the progress we can make together by putting our focus in the right places
233,    And this is the progress that results from restoring responsible leadership to our state’s 
234,"   Back to topFor example, four years ago, no one thought we’d ever pull ourselves up and out of the hole prior administrations andlegislatures had dug our pension system into"
235," This not only hurt our hardworking public employees, but it threatenedour very "
236,"  Working together, we made living up to our obligation a priority and in this "
237," With these investments, along with a strong stock market and anew and more responsible investment strategy, our pension funds are performing better than ever"
238,   And we’ve saved tomorrow’s taxpayers billions of dollars by living up to our obligation today
239,  We also reined-in the cost of public employee and retiree health bene
240," Forexample, we’ve cut more than $36 billion from the projected long-term costs of providing health care to our retiredpublic employees alone"
241, That’s good for them and for you
242,  And the size of state government itself is smaller today than it was when we took o
243,"  Four years ago, NJ TRANSIT was a national model of how not to run a mass-transit system"
244," Today, it stands as amodel of how to turn around a mass-transit system"
245,  When we took o
246,"  Rider safety, once a backburner issue, has been restored to the forefront"
247," New locomotives and passenger cars, andnewer and cleaner-running buses, are not only "
248,  The shortages of train engineers and bus operators that led to canceled routes have been back-
249,  And we did it without asking customers to pay one penny more in fares for four straight years
250,"  Over the past four years, we’ve also restored a basic sense of social and environmental justice, including enacting thenation’s strongest environmental justice law"
251,"   We’ve expanded and protected voting rights, and we’ve started down the long path of true criminal justice reform thatwill ultimately lead us to safer communities and stronger bonds of trust and goodwill between law enforcement andthe residents they serve"
252,"  We took on a focused and data-driven effort to combat the ongoing opioid use-epidemic, even as we fought thecoronavirus pandemic"
253,"  In that, we replaced stigma with compassion to close gaps in treatment, to expand access and use of life-savingmedicines like Naloxone, and to support and expand the work of harm reduction centers, among so much more"
254,"  While we are proud of the progress we are making, this critical work is far from done and will continue"
255, We continueto lose too many residents to the grip of opioid misuse
256,"  Four years ago, we set out to build a stronger and fairer New Jersey that would work for every family and in everycommunity"
257, We set out to make a more affordable and more responsive New Jersey
258,"  Well, we are who we said we’d be – boldly progressive, but also pragmatic"
259,"   And because of this, we are accomplishing both"
260," Note that I say “accomplishing,” not “accomplished"
261,” We still have much work to do
262, We are still clearing away thelong-fallen brush that has blocked the path to opportunity for too many New Jerseyans
263,   Back to topOur task now is to take the next giant leap forward – to turn the positive changes we’ve made in our laws into long-lasting and tangible progress for our working families and seniors
264,"  A few hours ago, my partners in the Legislature swore their oaths as the representatives of the residents they nowserve"
265,  Lieutenant Governor Oliver and I congratulate the new Senate leaders – Senate President Nick Scutari and MajorityLeader Teresa Ruiz – as well as the returning Assembly leadership of Speaker Craig Coughlin and Majority LeaderLouis Greenwald
266,"   And we hold out our hands in partnership and goodwill to the new Republican leaders, Senator Steve Oroho andAssemblyman John DiMaio"
267,  The people of New Jersey elected each of us in public o
268,  Up until November 2nd we wore either a letter “D” or “R” after our name
269, And we all take pride in that letter
270, That letterspeaks to a sense of our core beliefs and our personal ideals
271,  But now is the time to take these letters off
272," Now is the time to seek, in the words of John F"
273," Kennedy, “not theRepublican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer"
274,"”  You are sick and tired of the hyper-partisanship, the bickering, the inaction, the division, and the endless "
275, So am I
276,  And we don’t want that political stagnation to creep into our work here in Trenton
277, Not in our very backyard
278," Not whenthere is still too much uncertainty in our lives and our communities, and too many challenges ahead"
279,"  From today forward, for all of us, the politicking ends and the governing begins"
280, That’s true patriotism
281,"  We must continue to prove that the promise of a stronger and fairer New Jersey is real and open to every resident,every family, and every community"
282,"  Opportunity, affordability, and fairness must be linked"
283, One without the others is hollow
284, But all of them together arean unstoppable force for a brighter future and proof that the American Dream lives in New Jersey
285,  And no state represents both the glorious history and awesome future of the American Dream more than ours
286,"  So, this is our shared task for the year ahead …  A stronger New Jersey where we create opportunity and increase affordability because you want New Jersey to bemore affordable …  A fairer New Jersey where we work for tax fairness, and economic and social justice because you want a fair shot ata more prosperous future and at your American Dream"
287,  And a New Jersey where we continue down the path of recovery from the pandemic together
288,  This is what you expect
289," Moreover, this is what you deserve"
290,  Let’s work together in good faith and with common purpose
291, This doesn’t mean we won’t or even can’t disagree
292, But itshould mean that “compromise” and “common sense” are not dirty words
293,"  The response to an idea with which we disagree shouldn’t be “no, period,” but rather, “no, but,” meaning an opennessto cooperation and negotiation … to a give-and-take, not a take-it-or-leave-it"
294,"  Let’s also be mindful of the words of the late John Lewis, “We’re one people, we’re one family"
295, We all live in the samehouse
296,"”  With everything going on across our nation, and as we work to bring our state out from under the cloud of COVID,these words ring true in New Jersey"
297,   Back to topLet’s pledge to put the needs of every New Jerseyan before the wants of our party or any single person in it
298,  Let’s stop shouting down each other and get back to talking with each other
299,  Let’s prove that our words have actual value and meaning
300,  And let’s prove that our best days aren’t in our rear-view mirror
301,"   Let’s grab that more affordable New Jersey, a New Jersey rich with opportunity for all willing to work hard, which isjust ahead of us"
302,"  Thank you, all"
303, May God bless you and your families with a healthy and prosperous new year
304,   May God continue to bless the Great State of New Jersey and the United States of America

15,2022 State of the State AddressGovernor Jay Inslee“Action 
16,
17,
18," This Day”As prepared for delivery at noon, Jan"
19," 11, 2022 State Reception Room, Washington State CapitolHello and welcome, Washingtonians, to a critical year for our state"
20,We know every day of this legislative session is going to be an opportunity to make good on our commitments and to change the course of our future for the better
21, We have begun a short session with a long list of things to get done
22, I can encapsulate the state of our state very simply – we need action
23," We can wake up every morning the next 60 days understanding we need “action, this day” – which was Churchill’s first order at the beginning of World War II, but it serves to focus on the many tasks before us"
24,"I would like to start today by thanking our frontline workers, educators and child care providers, and our state employees for all they’ve done the last two years"
25," I want to thank those who administer emergency services and plow the roads to keep Washington moving – unprecedented weather events have demanded much of you already this year, and we are all grateful"
26,Thank you to the health care workers who have worked tirelessly for two years with little time for rest
27," You are heroes, and we are grateful for your service"
28,I am happy to welcome our new members in the Senate – Yasmin Trudeau and John Lovick – and Brandy Donaghy in the House
29," My thoughts are also with the family of former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Mary Fairhurst, who we lost in December"
30,And I would like to reiterate our condolences to the family of Sen
31," Doug Ericksen, who we lost after a struggle with COVID in December"
32," He is one of more than 10,000 Washingtonians 3lost to this virus – each one of whose lives mattered"
33," And while we mourn our losses, let us also realize that because of our actions, we have saved thousands of lives"
34," We still need to contribute to the fight against COVID, that’s why attendance here today is limited, and everyone is socially distanced"
35," We’re doing everything possible to keep people safe statewide right now: We are increasing access to testing, masking, and helping educators find new ways of doing business"
36, The Legislature has been a strong partner in this pandemic
37," Last session, they extended 26 emergency orders through the end of the pandemic and made laudable investments in our recovery efforts"
38,"This has been a long effort, but we are undaunted"
39,Look at all we have done together
40," If you compare our success to others, we’ve saved more than 17,000 lives"
41, These people are still with us because of what all Washingtonians have contributed to stay safe and healthy
42,"It’s not an accident that our state continues to be named one of the best places anywhere to live, work and do business"
43," Since I’ve had the honor of being governor, we have implemented one of the best paid family leave programs in the country; provided significant new funds to schools under McCleary; passed the best environmental justice legislation in America; passed the Fair Start for Kids Act to protect child care options; and successfully created more ways to connect people to careers beyond just the college path"
44," We came back from disasters such as the Skagit Bridge collapse, the Oso landslide, historic wildfires, heat waves, drought and now unprecedented flooding"
45, You as legislators have a lot to be proud of
46, But now we are going to be called upon to do more
47,We face a variety and dimension of demands greater than ever as we enter 2022
48, We must take action this day to keep and strengthen our commitments to those in need right now and in the future
49, We must take action this day to fight the homelessness crisis; 4Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State Addressto reverse social and economic disparities; to educate our children and serve those in foster care; to fund our transportation system; and to protect our salmon and orca
50," We must take action, this day, to fight the threat of climate change that is now hitting us hard"
51,"Over the last year I have met people experiencing homelessness across our state, in Tacoma, Moses Lake, Walla Walla, Seattle and Spokane"
52, We have seen what works to improve people’s lives: A private place to live with a sense of dignity
53, That’s why my supplemental budget includes an unprecedented $815 million investment in safe housing for those experiencing homelessness and to create more options for those struggling with housing availability
54," This budget would also increase behavioral health services, continuing my administration’s successful investments in these life-changing programs"
55,All of us know that wrap-around services are critical to helping people out of long-term homelessness
56, It is fundamental that people not only get a roof over their heads but get access to such services
57," We must provide rapid supportive housing as soon as possible, this year"
58,We also have to realize we need more opportunities for everyone when it comes to housing
59, We can’t get more housing if there’s nowhere to build it
60,We must pass legislation that removes antiquated barriers to middle housing options in our cities – such as duplexes and town homes – and provides more housing supply to make it available to all income levels
61," Look, we cannot tell our constituents we are fighting homelessness and yet not provide ways to build more housing"
62, That means we must allow housing that meets the realities of our tremendous population and economic growth this century
63," This is also a generational issue: If our children and grandchildren are ever going to afford a rent or mortgage, we need more affordable housing"
64,My budget also reflects our need to take direct action to reduce poverty
65," I created a Poverty Reduction Workgroup, made up of people whose lived experiences in poverty could inform our state’s actions"
66," Using their recommendations, my budget would create a 5Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State Address$125 million reinvestment fund to address economic and social disparities across decades that are the legacy of federal policies that hurt communities of color"
67," Our communities are suffering in other ways as well, like in our classrooms"
68,Students have lost opportunities during remote learning despite the best efforts of our educators
69," To keep schools open, we must invest more to deal with COVID and address learning opportunity loss"
70,"We are committed to having our schools open this year, but the impacts of necessary closures linger"
71," To help make sure educators and students have what they need, I propose reinvesting $900 million to help schools address students’ critical needs"
72," This proposal further empowers educators so they can innovate to address what kids have suffered through because of COVID, just as they have done throughout the pandemic"
73," Educators, when empowered, can develop solutions to overcome opportunity gaps"
74," My budget will increase the number of school counselors, nurses, psychologists and social workers available to serve K-12 students"
75, Anyone who works with kids will tell you these services are needed now more than ever
76, Young people in foster care and their families have also been uniquely impacted by the pandemic
77, My budget offers $80 million to pay providers more for housing and support foster youth with complex needs; and help young people transition out of foster care or juvenile justice
78,"While we put the pieces together to address the current needs that confront our communities, we also must take action this day to address the long-term, existential threats to this state"
79," In December, I spoke with astronaut Kayla Barron, a Richland High School graduate"
80, I was in my kitchen – Kayla was aboard the International Space Station
81," Kayla is a long way from home right now, traveling at 17,500 miles per hour above us and orbiting the Earth once every 90 minutes, so I was honored she took my call"
82,"6Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State AddressI asked Kayla what perspective this experience gave her about our collective home, our planet"
83, She said something that stuck with me
84,"Kayla told me she was amazed by how thin our atmosphere is, how at night there is a burnt orange glow at its edge revealing just how paper thin the layer is between a livable world – and nothingness"
85, She said this: “The most important thing we need to survive is the ability to breathe clean air
86,”Our planet’s fragile state is clear on the ground as well
87, Climate change is not merely a graph on a slide deck with an arrow pointed at calamity
88," It’s found in the eyes of people who saw floods go through their windows in Everson; evacuees who returned to see the charred ruins of their homes in Malden; or the Colville Tribes who lost 600,000 acres of timber to wildfires"
89," When I look into the eyes of people who have lost their home and see the pain they have, that’s the pain of climate change"
90, We have to do everything we can to fight it
91, Every corner of the state faces climate-related disasters today
92," Not tomorrow, but right now"
93, This is the fight for the future of our state
94," And we need action, this day"
95,My budget builds on the work we’ve done previously and puts $626 million more toward this noble effort
96, Legislators can be proud of the policies they’ve put to work here in our state
97, And it’s good to know we are not alone in this work
98, The world looks to our state as leaders in climate innovation
99," This was reaffirmed in November at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, where I led a coalition of 68 governments to commit to drastically reduce emissions"
100," Together, we are charting a path to fight climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 and get to net-zero by 2050"
101,"It is our state’s legal obligation to reduce emissions – but it is also practical, and most importantly it is a moral obligation"
102, Legislators can be proud their work created policies that will remove 43
103,5 million metric tons of emissions annually
104," But to meet our statutory commitment, we have to reduce emissions by 6 million more metric tons per year to reach 7Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State Addressour 2030 emissions limits"
105, That’s equivalent to the annual emissions of 1
106,3 million vehicles on the road
107," Through legislation, we can rev up this future and make new and existing buildings perform better"
108, We can modernize regulations and incentivize industry to ensure clean energy projects are built here in Washington with living-wage jobs; and make electric vehicles more affordable by giving families thousands of dollars in rebates
109,"Buildings are the state’s second largest source of emissions, and many of them are energy inefficient, wasting resources and costing consumers"
110," With buildings lasting anywhere from 50 to 100 years, we must act now to give Washingtonians more efficiencies and to decarbonize our homes, apartments, offices, retail spaces, and more"
111," To accomplish this, we have to require gas utilities to chart a path to decarbonize under the Climate Commitment Act"
112, We can improve conditions for developers to grow clean energy resources here in our state
113,"Look, there’s good news here"
114," We see the future’s promise already burgeoning in Washington, at companies like Eviation in Arlington, where they’re making the world’s first, all-electric, commuter airplane; Vicinity Motor Corp in Ferndale where they’re manufacturing electric buses; at the new solar farms popping up like dandelions in eastern Washington; and net zero buildings such as Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle and the Catalyst building in Spokane"
115," We see clean energy projects built with strong labor standards, growing a broad range of union jobs and apprenticeship opportunities in their local communities, like at the Rattlesnake Flats Wind Farm in Adams County"
116,"Now, with all the challenges we face, why do I believe this Legislature is up to the job of fighting carbon pollution? It’s because this is the Legislature that has in its hands the most beautiful place on the planet and the health of more than 7 million people"
117, I know you won’t let the people down
118,8Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State AddressThe same goes for salmon
119," As the future of salmon goes, so goes the future of our state"
120," Our region’s salmon are threatened by climate change, pollution and habitat loss"
121,My budget would put $187 million toward salmon recovery
122," We must restore the green corridors along rivers and streams known as riparian habitat, which keeps the water clean and cool"
123, Our legislation sets a unique ecological blueprint for each river and stream habitat to conserve and restore these critical lands
124," This plan includes the Lorraine Loomis Act, named for the Swinomish leader in tribal salmon management, who we lost in August"
125, Lorraine was an inspiration to Washingtonians young and old
126, She brought us together in favor of salmon
127,Our salmon cannot wait
128," They need action, this day"
129," To realize this future, we must do it together with our partners"
130, Few are as critical in this effort as Washington state’s tribal communities
131," I am introducing legislation that provides a stronger, clearer consultation process for projects that get funding through the Climate Commitment Act"
132, We make progress when we work together
133,We also need to invest in our aging transportation system in a way that meets the demands of the future while aggressively decreasing the impacts of climate change from the same system
134, We need more transportation and less pollution at the same time
135, That’s why my 2022 transportation budget is no ordinary supplemental proposal
136,We have a unique opportunity with one-time and new federal funds – along with state money – to provide nearly $1 billion to fund clean transportation programs and activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector; preserve the infrastructure we have; and support critical investments to improve ferry service reliability
137, This includes $324 million to support ferry electrification
138, We desperately need boats – cleaner boats – to give Washingtonians reliable ferry services
139," And to legislators: If you have bigger ambitions or bolder ideas, I am ready to engage, discuss and support your efforts"
140,9Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State AddressMy budget also supports increased diversity and inclusion in the transportation sector by addressing disparities in hiring and recruiting a diverse workforce at those entities
141,The broader transportation system remains our number one emitter of greenhouse gases that pollute our air and water and drive climate change
142," Last session, this Legislature passed historic laws to reduce emissions – including the Climate Commitment Act – and we must not hesitate to take action, this day, to implement those laws"
143, We need a clean fuel standard as well
144, These laws must go into effect in concert with our transportation budget
145, And I look forward to working with legislators to do this
146,"We have proposed necessary and prudent investments this session, but we also have to invest in our financial stability"
147," To assure financial stability, my plan will build the reserve back to pre-pandemic levels in just four years from now"
148, My budget puts $2
149,5 billion toward our financial resilience this biennium
150, Putting this money in our Rainy Day and reserve funds will place our state on better footing for the next emergency
151,We just marked the 1-year anniversary of the insurrection in our nation’s Capitol
152, That insurrection continues to this day under the banner of the “Big Lie
153,"” The right to representative government is under attack in this country, and in our state"
154,I am pro-democracy
155," All elected officials and others who care about our state and nation should be pro-democracy, too"
156," Former Secretary of State Kim Wyman deserves our respect for the exemplary and nonpartisan way she carried out her duties in the face of these same threats, and that is why I am so happy to welcome former Sen"
157, Steve Hobbs as our new secretary of state
158," Like Kim Wyman, he will help keep our state and local elections safe and secure"
159,"It is time we stand up to those who challenge the integrity of our elections, who undermine basic democratic principles and who would do away with the rule of law"
160," I call on all legislators, Democrat and Republican, to acknowledge forcefully that the 2020 elections were won fair and square under our Constitution – and to denounce those officials who spread deception that strikes at the foundation of democracy"
161,10Governor Jay Inslee2022 State of the State AddressSo I think we should outlaw efforts by politicians to knowingly spread lies about elections when those lies result in violence – violence we have already seen in state capitals and our nation’s capital
162," As we close today, I will reiterate that this may be a “short session,” but it is unlike any in our history"
163, We must act according to what this moment demands
164, We must be big
165, We must be bold
166," We must act at a scale commensurate to our challenges because of the multiple, urgent crises facing our state"
167, Too much is at stake
168, I am confident we can do this – because I have seen the Legislature rise to the moment before
169," But we must take action, this day"
170,We will continue to build our resiliency against COVID
171, We will meet the challenge of climate change while building the clean energy future with good jobs here in Washington
172, We will restore our children’s opportunities
173, We will make necessary revisions to our long-term care bill and our police accountability measures
174, We will protect salmon and bring back our orca
175, We will house those impacted by homelessness and behavioral health conditions and provide more affordable housing options for everyone
176, This is our charge
177, We can do this if we act together
178,There is no time to lose
179, We can start now by taking action – this day

1," In the address, Governor Hochul outlined nine key components ofher agenda: rebuilding our healthcare economy, protecting public safety and taking strong actionagainst gun violence, investing in New York’s people, investing in New York’s communities,making New York’s housing system more aﬀordable, equitable, and stable, making New York anational leader in climate action and green jobs, rebuilding New York’s teacher workforce andreimagining higher education, advancing New York’s place as a national equity model, andmaking critical reforms to restore New Yorkers’ faith in their government"
2,"The Governor's remarks as prepared are available below:Thank you, Lieutenant Governor"
3, You have been doing an outstanding job in such a short timeand I’m proud to have you by my side as we deliver for the people of New York
4,I also want to thank my partners in government
5," State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, ()State AttorneyGeneral Tish James, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Majority LeaderCrystal Peoples-Stokes, and I hope Speaker of the Assembly Carl Heastie gets well soon"
6,"And thank you to Pastor Soloman Dees and to Allie Navarette, for representing the Girl Scouts sowell"
7,"As I stand before you, I am well aware of the signiﬁcance of this moment: the ﬁrst time in NewYork’s history that a woman has delivered this annual address"
8, But I didn’t come here to makehistory
9, I came to make a diﬀerence
10,"To be sure, I have a deep reverence for our State’s remarkable past"
11," And we’re honoring it bycoming together in this beautiful Assembly Chamber, its original, and rightful, setting with electedleaders, joined together to serve the public"
12,"I’m fond of quoting a former member of this body, and one-time Governor, Teddy Roosevelt, whosaid: “It’s not the critic who counts… The credit belongs to the man – or, shall we say, the woman– who is actually in the arena"
13,"”To my colleagues and partners in government, for too long, Albany’s Executive and Legislativebranches were ﬁghting each other in that arena"
14, No more
15, That ends now
16,What I am proposing is a whole New Era for New York
17, The days of Governors disregarding therightful role of this legislature are over
18, The days of the Governor of New York and Mayor of NewYork City wasting time on petty rivalries are over
19, The days of New Yorkers questioning whethertheir government is actually working for them are over
20,And the days of three men in a room are clearly over – just ask the Majority Leader
21,We know that women are always held to a higher standard
22, So I know that I must not just meetbut exceed expectations for this to no longer be an historic achievement… but rather the norm
23,So we will do things diﬀerently
24,   From now on: we will share success
25, We will ﬁnd commonground
26," We will restore trust in this government, because it has been eroded for far too long"
27,And we will ﬁght like hell – not for turf…not for credit – but for New Yorkers
28,"I’ve been proud to stand with the members of this legislature, signing more than 400 of your billsinto law since September"
29, And we’re just getting started
30,  New Yorkers need the help of everyone in this room to pass an ambitious agenda
31," One thatresponds to the Covid-19 pandemic but also rebuilds our healthcare and teacher workforces,provides tax relief to those who need it most, speeds up economic growth and creates goodpaying, middle-class jobs, strengthens our infrastructure and confronts climate change, securespublic safety, makes housing more aﬀordable, ensures every New Yorker has a roof over theirheads and enacts bold reforms for our State government"
32,My fellow New Yorkers: This agenda is for you
33,Every single initiative is ﬁltered through the lens of how it will help you and your families
34," I knowyou’re exhausted, I know you want this pandemic to be over, I know you’re worried about theeconomy, inﬂation, your kids and their education and what the future holds"
35,We’ve endured so much hardship over these past two years
36," We’ve buried loved ones,experienced seismic shifts in our daily lives and missed out on so many of life’s preciousmilestones – holidays, weddings, graduations,the birth of a grandchild"
37,"There has been so much loss – of too many lives, and of too many of our hopes and dreams"
38,"And now, just when we thought we were turning a corner, there’s a new variant"
39, Another surge incases
40, It feels like déjà vu
41,And I know you’re all asking: Will we ever get through this? Yes
42, We will
43,   We’re New Yorkers
44, We’ve been knocked down before
45, We’ve been counted out
46," And inresponse, we never fail to defy the odds and rise to new heights"
47,New York always rises from the ashes
48, That is why I believe that this is not a moment ofdespair…
49,but a moment of great possibility
50," Because while we are in the midst of an all-consuming crisis we must also remember that if we make the right choices, right now it will end"
51,"But ﬁrst, we must weather the storm around us"
52, That means controlling this virus and not letting itcontrol us
53," When I took oﬃce, we immediately enacted a comprehensive pandemic plan and we’vecontinued to adapt as new variants like Omicron have emerged"
54," We’re doing everything we canto keep New Yorkers healthy: setting policies that have made our vaccination rate one of thehighest in the country, activating a military-style operation with vax and test sites, deploying theNational Guard to our hospitals and nursing homes and sending out 37 million tests across thestate"
55,"During this winter surge, our laser focus is on keeping our kids in school, businesses open andNew Yorkers’ lives as normal as possible"
56,"We are attacking this virus head-on, armed with a tactical, science-based approach and we areready for whatever comes next"
57,"But as we all know too well, this is more than a public health crisis"
58," We now need to support thepeople, places and industries hit hardest starting with the New Yorkers who have been on thefrontlines since day one"
59,"During those terrifying early months, while many hunkered down at home our healthcareworkers and ﬁrst responders showed up, day after day, night after night, double shift after doubleshift, putting their lives on the line to save others"
60,They’re not only physically exhausted – they’re emotionally exhausted too
61," I’ve seen it in theireyes, in hospitals from Buﬀalo to Potsdam just last week"
62,"That exhaustion combined with pre-existing staﬃng shortages, has resulted in a crisis"
63, We simplydo not have enough healthcare workers in our hospitals or in our long-term care facilities in ourambulances or in the homes of our loved ones
64,"The health of every New Yorker depends on a strong, stable, and equitable healthcare systemand healthcare workers are its very foundation"
65, Bold action is required – before any more timepasses
66,"First, we must stop the current hemorrhaging of healthcare workers and we’re going to do it notjust by SAYING we owe them a debt of gratitude but actually PAYING them the debt we owe,starting with a retention bonus of up to $3,000 to our health and direct care workers and we willdrive higher salaries throughout the healthcare workforce, so those doing God’s work here onearth are no longer doing it for minimum wage"
67,"Beyond salary, we will make it easier for doctors and nurses from other States to practice withtheir existing licenses here in New York"
68," We’ll expand the capacity of our medical institutions somore students can train for high-demand healthcare jobs, and we’ll make it possible for them toget that training with free tuition and stipends if they remain here after they graduate"
69,  A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic demands a once-in-a-lifetime response:That’s why I’m setting an ambitious goal to grow our healthcare workforce by 20% over the nextﬁve years
70," And we will make the largest investment in healthcare in State history, $10 billiondollars"
71," As we bolster our bone-tired healthcare workforce, we know they aren’t the only heroesof the pandemic"
72,"I am so grateful to the county leaders, school superintendents, administrators, parents andteachers for working so closely with us … to get kids back to school this week"
73,"The role of a teacher is irreplaceable in a child’s life and as the past two years have hammeredhome, they’re irreplaceable in a parent’s life, too"
74,"As a mother, I know this ﬁrst hand"
75, This workforce is also stressed and overworked
76," So we willramp up eﬀorts to recruit and retain teachers – with more eﬀective training and support, fasterand easier certiﬁcation, and stronger career pipelines and ladders"
77,And we will add more mental health professionals in schools to heal the wounds inﬂicted duringthe isolation of remote learning
78, Others are hurting as well
79," Families, small business owners,farmers – they all need our help"
80, They need it now and they’re going to get it
81,We will accelerate a $1
82,"2 billion-dollar tax cut originally scheduled to take eﬀect between nowand 2025, so that it all occurs earlier"
83, That means more than 6 million middle-class taxpayers getmore money in their pockets sooner at a time when inﬂation is robbing them of any gains inincome
84,"To help with property taxes, we will provide a $1 billion middle-class property tax rebate to morethan 2 million homeowners"
85," And to help parents get back to work, we’re going to expand accessto aﬀordable childcare to 100,000 more working families and invest $75 million in childcareworker wages"
86,"We will also deliver $100 million in much-needed relief to nearly 200,000 small businesses, tokeep their doors open and weather what the next few months bring"
87," These businesses are theeconomic engines of small towns and big cities alike, they’re what make our communities uniqueand give them personality"
88,"I should know, I’ve shopped and eaten in diners in most of them"
89,"I also helped my mother open a ﬂower shop and my sister start a small tech company, so I knowﬁrsthand how hard it is"
90," I know the risks taken by owners and entrepreneurs, and the barriersfaced by women"
91, So many small businesses were pushed to the brink
92, Thousands of bars andrestaurants – the souls of our neighborhoods – have had to close
93,"For others, hanging on by a thread, survival depends on whether they can create more spaceoutdoors, a tough task during our New York winters"
94," To help oﬀset these costs, we will provide atax credit for COVID-related purchases, like outdoor heaters and seating"
95, And we’re also goingto do something bars and restaurants have been asking for…
96,to once again allow the sale of to-go drinks – a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year
97,"Cheers, New York"
98,The farmers who supply restaurant kitchens – and our own – need a lifeline as well
99,"  I’ve visitedfarms from Genesee County to the North Fork of Long Island, and life is tough, even in goodyears"
100," So we’re going to support them through a tax credit for the overtime hours they arepaying, an increase in the Investment Tax Credit and an extension and doubling of the FarmWorkforce Retention Credit"
101,This will also begin to address the workforce shortage so many farms struggle with
102,"This is how we will begin to help healthcare workers, educators, small businesses, farms andfamilies deal with the devastating economic impacts of COVID"
103,"But beyond the pandemic, my agenda reﬂects my belief that we cannot allow the virus to grip usso tightly that it constrains us from looking to the future"
104, Longing for a simple return to our pre-pandemic world and way of life would not only be timid and unimaginative
105," It would ignore ourhistory and go against everything that makes New York, New York"
106,"If we can’t embrace the possibilities that come out of times like these, then we fail to honor thelegacy of the daring, visionary New Yorkers who came before us"
107,The portrait of Franklin Roosevelt that hangs above the mantle in the Governor’s residence is mydaily reminder of what leadership during a crisis is all about
108," First as Governor, and then asPresident, FDR literally rebuilt the economy from the ground up after the crash of ‘29"
109," More thangiving people jobs, he gave people hope"
110," The policies of his New Deal didn’t just help families who lost everything, they spurred decadesof economic growth and the birth of the middle class"
111," Again and again, he focused on the stormswirling around him, but kept one eye on the horizon, always planning for the day when theclouds would part"
112,That is exactly what we are doing now
113, This pandemic did not create all the problems we’refacing today
114, It simply forced us to hold up a mirror and see the cracks in our society that hadbeen too easy to ignore before
115, This crisis has created an opportunity to redeﬁne ourselves –and we must embrace it
116,"But as we embark on this New Era for our State, we need to take a hard look in that mirror anddeal with harsh realities"
117," Like the fact that 300,000 New Yorkers left our State last year"
118," That’s thesteepest population drop of ANY State in the nation, an alarm bell that cannot be ignored"
119," Tothose who left temporarily because of the pandemic or are trying to decide their next stepsduring these uncertain times, I have one message: you do not want to miss what’s going tohappen next"
120,"Right now, in real time, we are building a new New York worthy of your talents and ambitions"
121,We’re going to jumpstart our economic recovery by being the most business-friendly and worker-friendly State in the nation
122,"To entice people and businesses, we’re investing millions of dollars to transform the downtownsof our cities into magnets for new jobs and new opportunities and position both legacy andemerging industries for success"
123,New York is already home to some of the most consequential industries in the world
124," Finance,retail, healthcare, technology, fashion, entertainment, just to name a few"
125,But there is plenty of room for growth
126," More shovel-ready sites for new manufacturers andwarehouses, improvements in our freight infrastructure and investments in the technology thatwill power the jobs of the future"
127, And we’re going to make sure we have a workforce trained tostep into these jobs
128,"That’s why we will invest smartly and strategically in workforce development programs whichsimply means matching people to training, to jobs"
129,I know the demand is strong
130," At every one of the thousands of workplaces I’ve visited, theuniversal complaint is not having enough trained workers"
131," Every single place, it’s the same"
132,"That’s why we will reboot our Workforce Development Oﬃce, house it in Empire StateDevelopment so we can build stronger partnerships with employers and move funding throughour Regional Economic Development Councils so we grow programs that train for jobs that areactually in demand in diﬀerent parts of the State"
133," And the smart way to do it is to have school districts, community colleges, SUNY and CUNY allfocused on the same objectives"
134,"We are going to incentivize success, by tying a portion of workforce funding to high jobplacement rates"
135,"  We’re also going to make it easier to qualify as an MWBE, so everyone canhave access to opportunities"
136," It’s a commonsense approach, backed by an uncommon level offunding"
137, And it’s going to help supercharge our economy
138,Our goal is for New York to be known nationally as the place that grows and attracts the talent –and the businesses will follow
139," And for businesses to succeed, they need a well-trained andeducated workforce"
140,I believe to my very core that there is nothing more valuable than education and training when itcomes to unlocking opportunity and prosperity
141," It changes lives, across generations"
142,I know what education did for my own family’s circumstances
143," My grandparents ﬂed Ireland asteenagers because they had nothing – they were poor, with no hint of opportunity in their homecountry"
144," My grandfather ﬁrst became a migrant farm worker in the ﬁelds of South Dakota, thenlater he and Grandma were domestic workers and then, it all changed when he heard there weregreat jobs in a place called Buﬀalo, New York at the Bethlehem steel plant"
145,"Grandma found a job at Bell Aerospace, making parts for our planes during World War II"
146,  Thatwas their ticket to the life that they came in search of
147," But what really transformed my family was the fact that my father was able to get a collegedegree – at night, while working by day at the same steel plant as his father"
148,"If he hadn’t taken that leap, and invested in his own education, I would be living a very diﬀerentlife today"
149, My whole family would be
150," That’s why I am so focused on expanding educationalopportunities, starting by making the State’s tuition assistance program available to part-timestudents"
151, I believe that SUNY and CUNY are engines of social mobility and still have untapped potentialthat needs to be harnessed and unleashed
152,"So today, I am outlining a vision to make SUNY the BEST statewide public higher educationsystem in the nation"
153," How? Recruiting world-class faculty, creating ﬂagship institutions at StonyBrook and the University at Buﬀalo, investing more in our premier research facilities atBinghamton and Albany, leaning into the strengths of our four-year comprehensive colleges, ourtechnology colleges, and our community colleges, providing childcare on each campus,Increasing enrollment to 500,000 students by 2030, making SUNY a national leader on equity,increasing the number and diversity of people in every community with degrees and credentialsthat launch middle class careers and ensuring that SUNY campuses spur economic growth intheir surrounding communities"
154,"As we upgrade our Statewide higher education institutions, we also acknowledge that there arepopulations at-risk of falling through the cracks unless we target job training and educationopportunities to them as well"
155,"For example, we know that incarcerated people who participate in correctional educationprograms are far less likely to reoﬀend and 13 times more likely to obtain employment afterreturning home"
156,That outcome beneﬁts the formerly incarcerated…employers in need of workers…
157,the taxpayersof New York State – and it’s the right thing to do
158,"So today I’m announcing a new “Jails-to-Jobs,” initiative, so incarcerated people with have thesupport they need to ﬁnd employment during re-entry"
159, We’re also going to restore the TuitionAssistance Program for incarcerated people—ending a 30-year ban
160," As we create economic opportunity in every sector, there’s one industry that will be workingaround the clock for years to come, my friends in the construction trades, building infrastructurethe likes of which we’ve never seen"
161,Infrastructure can mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people
162," To me, it’s exciting because it’s allabout creating connections"
163,"  Connecting neighborhoods, connecting people to jobs andconnecting people to their families"
164,"Substandard infrastructure can mean long commutes, lost time from family, even missing a child’sbedtime"
165, Time in a tire repair shop after hitting a pothole adds more stress than anyone needs
166,That’s why I view building and improving our infrastructure as a quality of life issue
167,"In November, I stood with my former colleagues in Congress on the White House lawn whenPresident Biden signed the historic infrastructure bill, giving us a once-in-a-century chance toinvest"
168," We cannot let this moment slip by, and we won’t"
169,New Yorkers demand the best and that’s exactly what they’re going to get
170, Just look at what myadministration has already announced over the past four months
171,"We will ﬁnally transform Penn Station into world-class facility worthy of our City, ensure that theGateway Project ﬁnally moves forward, deliver long overdue upgrades to both LaGuardia andJFK Airports, and ﬁnish the 2nd Avenue Subway to connect East Harlem to jobs"
172,But we’re just getting started
173,"  Today, I’m announcing a bold idea—— take an old, unused, 14-mile-long right-of-way and createwhat we’re calling the Inter-Borough Express, new rail service that will connect Brooklyn andQueens"
174,"I am directing the MTA to immediately commence an environmental review, so we can get thisproject rolling down the track and I’m also directing the Port Authority to get moving on theCross-Harbor freight tunnel"
175,"As I said, infrastructure is about connections"
176," We need to reconnect neighborhoods that weresevered by asphalt highways, disproportionately impacting communities of color"
177,"We’re going to reverse the damage done more than half a century ago, with projects like theKensington Expressway in Buﬀalo, I-81 in Syracuse, the Inner Loop in Rochester, and the Cross-Bronx Expressway"
178,"I’ve traveled to every one of our 62 counties in each of the past seven years, so I know nearlyevery road, highway, bridge"
179,I also have personal experience with just about every pothole in New York – especially on theLong Island Expressway
180," I’m coming after them, too"
181,"And we are making the largest ever investment in New York’s digital infrastructure, putting $1BILLION into connecting more New Yorkers with high-speed internet"
182, This investment will boostinnovation and economic growth—especially in our most remote communities
183,There’s one more critical piece of our plan to rebuild our infrastructure — making it more resilientagainst climate change
184," Just days after being sworn into oﬃce, we were slammed with HurricaneIda"
185,"  I walked the ﬂooded streets of East Elmhurst, Queens, and witnessed the aftermath of anepic collision between Mother Nature and our inferior infrastructure, with devastatingconsequences"
186,  It was a cruel reminder that too much time has already been lost in the ﬁght against climatechange
187, These events are no longer rare – the next one is coming
188, Look no further than theUpstate counties constantly battered by “500 year” ﬂooding or the tunnels in New York City andcommunities on Long Island still undergoing repairs more than a decade after Hurricane Sandyhit
189,"This is a threat to our way of life – here and now – and that’s why we must, and will, implementan ambitious agenda to meet this moment"
190,We’ve already started with increasing the Environmental Bond Act to $4 billion to go on theballot this Fall so we have the resources we need
191,"I’m now announcing a nation-leading, $500 million investment in oﬀshore wind energy that willcreate thousands of good-paying green jobs"
192,"As we build out our wind-energy capacity, and continue our transition to clean energy, ourreliance on fossil fuels must be phased out"
193," In September, I announced two clean energy mega-projects to put us on a path to achieve the ambitious goal of cutting 80%  of New York City’spower plant emissions by 2030"
194," New construction in the State will be zero-emission by 2027,and we will build climate-friendly, electric homes and promote electric cars, trucks, and buses"
195,Protecting our environment is personal to me
196," I was born at a time, and in a place, where orangesmoke billowed out of factory smokestacks literally blocking the skies, with a horrible stench Ican still recall to this day while also dumping toxic waste into one of the world’s largestfreshwater lakes"
197,I lived surrounded by the causes of climate change – and now I’m living with its eﬀects
198,"Now, while we confront the climate crisis – we will address one of the most basic of humanneeds, that is to feel safe, on streets, in schools and in homes"
199,"Time and again, New Yorkers tell me that they don’t feel safe, that they don’t like what they seeon the streets and that things feel diﬀerent right now – and not for the better"
200,It’s not just New York City – it’s cities across America
201," Many factors contribute to our streetsfeeling less safe, including the very real uptick in gun violence nationwide since the start of thepandemic"
202,"Now, this isn’t a return to the dark days of the 70s, ’80s and ’90s"
203, But that’s not our metric forsuccess
204, We need to get back on track
205," In October, I signed a bill that closed loopholes in gun possession and registration, making iteasier for law enforcement to track down weapons used in crimes and prevent gun traﬃcking"
206,   And we banned the sale of ghost guns
207," Going forward, we will double down on practical, provenlaw enforcement strategies to combat gun violence"
208," Working with Mayor Adams and theLieutenant Governor, who I’ve asked to take the lead for our Administration, we will form a newconsortium between the New York State Police, the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies,including neighboring states to trace guns used in crimes and stop the ﬂow of guns into ourState"
209,We will triple the resources for both our gun-tracing eﬀorts as well as for successful community-based programs
210,"  Fighting gun violence is critical, but we must address other factors contributing to tthe pervasiveunease many are feeling on our streets"
211,That includes the humanitarian crisis unfolding before us: the rise in street homelessness
212, Ourfellow New Yorkers who are in this situation deserve our compassion and they will receive it –along with our support
213,"We will create teams of mental health professionals and social workers, who will partner withNew York City outreach workers, to reach homeless individuals and move them into shelters andhousing"
214,"At the same time, we know that street homelessness only accounts for a small fraction of thehomeless population"
215,"Beyond those sleeping on the streets, tens of thousands more people move in and out ofshelters as they try to secure a place to call home and tragically many of them are children"
216,"We need to focus on addressing the root causes of homelessness unmet mental health needs:poverty, addiction, and housing insecurity"
217," Every New Yorker deserves access to aﬀordable housing, whether they are at risk ofhomelessness or simply struggle to pay the rent on time each month"
218,"So many people not only face tremendous economic hardship, but the double hit is that housingprices have also continued to escalate beyond the reach of many, worsening the situation evenmore"
219,"That is why I am launching a new, ﬁve-year housing plan to create and preserve 100,000aﬀordable homes, including 10,000 units with supportive services for high-risk populations, likerunaway youth and formerly incarcerated individuals"
220,And we can no longer ignore the plight of NYCHA residents living in sometimes deplorableconditions
221, The Lieutenant Governor and I will work with the City of New York and the Legislatureon concrete action this session
222, We’ll also ﬁx outdated land use laws that hold back housingsupply
223,We’ll encourage transit-oriented development and the conversion of hotels and oﬃces tohousing is also part of our housing strategy
224,Accomplishing everything I’ve proposed hinges on one thing a government people trust
225,"Across the country, trust in government is reaching all-time lows"
226, We know why
227," Misinformationand lies on social media a widening partisan divide, gridlock in Washington even outright attackson the right to vote"
228,It’s getting harder and harder for people to believe in their elected oﬃcials at all levels ofgovernment
229,"The question is: How do we restore their faith?Here in New York, our answer is to demonstrate what good and honest governance looks like"
230,And we’ve already announced our ﬁrst step
231,We are submitting a proposal to the legislature to enact two term limits for Statewide oﬃcials
232," For government to work, those of us in power cannot continue to cling to it"
233,We need to continually pass the baton to new leaders with diﬀerent perspectives and freshideas
234,Our reforms include a ban on outside income for Statewide oﬃcials because our only job shouldbe to serve the people of New York
235,But that’s not the only part of the system that’s not working
236,"It’s no secret that recent events have called into question the eﬀectiveness of the JointCommission on Public Ethics, JCOPE"
237,I will introduce legislation to replace that commission with a new ethics enforcement watchdog
238,One with real teeth
239, One that answers to New Yorkers – not to politicians
240,None of these changes will ﬁx our government overnight and having these safeguards in placewon’t mean those of us in elected oﬃce won’t stumble or make honest mistakes
241,"But by putting much-needed reforms in place, we can at least begin to restore public trust byfocusing on what REALLY matters to our residents"
242,What you’ve just heard is a mere sampling of the more than 220 proposals that ﬁll a book we’rereleasing today
243,Quite an extraordinary accomplishment given our 134 days in oﬃce
244,And I commend the hard-working staﬀ who helped me shape this agenda— I’m proud to havethe most diverse… talented team New York State has ever had
245,Before we leave here and get to work
246,I want to pause a moment to reﬂect on our State’s unique story and the destiny that lies beforeus
247," Since its beginning, our country has attracted people from around the world, in search of an idealthat made leaving their homeland worth the risk"
248,Two simple words: American Dream
249,"And in pursuit of this, millions found their way here, to us"
250,"New York has always meant the promise of a better life, for those immigrating through EllisIsland, ﬂeeing slavery in the South, or resettling here as refugees from Afghanistan"
251,"Our state is nationally recognized as the birthplace of movements for equality and progress, thelabor movement, the women’s rights movement, the LGBTQ+ movement, the environmentalmovement, the racial justice movement, they all were started HERE by enlightened New Yorkers"

146,"As we enter the new year, there are many important opportunities to build on the collaborative work we’vedone over the past seven"
147,Two of those opportunities are closing loopholes that threaten public safety
148,"The ﬁrst loophole allows those charged with violent crimes, who may also have lengthy criminal records, towalk free before trial"
149,"And the second leaves residents, many of them women, with little recourse when an ex-partner attempts toviolate them and destroy their lives"
150,"We've ﬁled bills to deal with these issues three times, to no avail"
151, The time to do something about this is longpast
152,The Lieutenant Governor and I recently listened to several women tell us their survival stories
153, It was one ofthe most diﬃcult conversations we’ve ever been part of
154,"One after another, these women described, in graphic detail, how they survived multiple physical andpsychological assaults, and how these loopholes actually protected the men who were terrorizing them"
155,It was awful
156,Current law is clearly not working
157," These women were bothered, battered, bruised and beaten time and timeagain by their abusers, and nothing changed"
158, We felt their desperation
159,It would be impossible to listen to their stories and walk away believing the Commonwealth is serious aboutprotecting these women
160,"Another woman came forward to detail how an ex-partner, unbeknownst to her, had taken dozens of lewdpictures of her and posted them on the internet"
161,"And if it couldn’t get any more awful, she then saw the note from him on the website: “video coming soon"
162,"”A lifetime of relationships, a small business she owned, a basic sense of privacy we all take for granted, wereshattered by one man’s despicable actions"
163,Massachusetts is one of only two states that doesn’t treat this as a crime
164, 48 other states treat this as a crime
165,Because it is a crime
166,These women had the courage to come forward and publicly tell their stories
167, They deserve to be heard
168, Andthey and the women they speak for deserve a vote on these two pieces of legislation
169,"As we come out of the pandemic, we know we have a mental health crisis"
170,"Like many things, it was there before COVID arrived"
171," But the anxiety, disruption and the isolation that camewith COVID has made it worse and more visible"

175,"gov/news/governor-baker-delivers-2022-state-of-the-commonwealth-address7/11Before the pandemic, we ﬁled a health care reform bill that would improve access to mental health services"
176,"Some pieces of it, like telehealth, became important parts of our eﬀort to expand access to care during thepandemic"
177," Since that time, the legislature has written telehealth into state law"
178, But many other parts of that2019 proposal have not been addressed
179,"The message remains the same: the healthcare system doesn’t value behavioral health services, primary careand geriatric services"
180," As a result, there are enormous staﬀ and clinician shortages in exactly the areas of carethat we need most"
181,"We know the legislature cares deeply about this issue, and we look forward to working with you to ﬁnish thiswork during this legislative session"
182,"We also appreciated the chance to testify recently before the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities& Energy on our fourth climate proposal"
183, This one builds on our very successful oﬀshore wind agenda andincludes the creation of a $750 million Clean Energy Innovation Fund
184,There are big ideas looking for a chance to test themselves in our academic institutions and our cutting-edgeresearch organizations

194," We know there is much to do, and we need to movequickly"
195,"In addition, we’ll soon ﬁle a transportation bond bill to ensure we get the full beneﬁt of the federal BipartisanInfrastructure Law"
196,"As you know, accessing these federal dollars requires state government to authorize the funds that will pay forour share of federally approved projects"
197,"Smart, disciplined ﬁscal management has made it possible for us to maximize federal participation in dozensof projects"
198," There’s a long list of opportunities here, but a big piece of these funds will be awarded through acompetitive process"
199,We need to move quickly to secure these dollars
200,Fiscal discipline also makes it possible for us to make strategic decisions about tax fairness and ourcompetitive position
201,The pandemic has proven that we now live in a new world where people have more ﬂexibility about where theylive and work
202,"To encourage our citizens to continue to call Massachusetts home and to help those struggling to make endsmeet because of rising inﬂation, we’ll ﬁle several tax breaks in our budget proposal later this week"

208," Our budget doubles the tax break for childrenand dependents, because every Massachusetts family deserves a break"
209," We’ll also ask lawmakers to eliminate income taxes for the lowest paid 230,000 taxpayers here in theCommonwealth"
210," Instead of paying income taxes, these people should be able to use their earnings to pay fornecessities, like food, housing and transportation"
211,Rents are also rising while wages remain relatively ﬂat
212, It’s time to give renters a bigger tax break on theirmonthly payments
213,It’s also been a tough two years for seniors
214, We’ll ask the legislature to give them a break on their propertytaxes and make our estate tax more competitive with the rest of the country

216, It's time for us to invest in Massachusetts families
217, To give them back some of the tax revenue they createdthrough their hard work

280,"Today, it’s clearly more diﬃcult to build trust, to collaborate in public life than it once was"
281,"The explosion of social media, the arrival of hundreds of news channels and information distributionplatforms"
282, And the ongoing churn of information have made it almost impossible for anyone in public life whowants to collaborate to build trust
283,Facts are often fungible and curated
284, Missteps play out in real time and can go viral in the most bizarre andunusual ways
285, Context is non-existent
286," And in many cases, history and current events get twisted to supportwhatever point of view someone is advocating for"
287,But the answer to the swirl and chaos of modern life is not more of the same poisonous brew
288,The answer is to stand up and accept the responsibility that comes with the work
289, To understand that trust isearned and collaboration is how diﬃcult things get done
290,Many of the projects we’ve worked on with our colleagues in local government would never have happenedwithout trust
291, Many of the most important pieces of legislation we’ve enacted over the past seven years wouldnot have happened without trust
292,Trust is where possibility in public life comes from
293,"If you can’t tell someone you work with, partner with, or collaborate with, what you really think it’s very hard todo small things"
294, Much less big ones
295,"Here in Massachusetts, we’ve done big things and small ones"
296,"At a time when so much of our public dialogue is designed to destroy trust, to manipulate facts, and to pullpeople apart"
297," We’ve partnered with one another, and shared success and blame along the way"
298,"We should continue to focus on building and maintaining positive, collaborative relationships"
299, Because theywork for the people we serve and it’s what most voters expect from us
300,They want us to work hard and collaborate the same way they do
301," To listen to them as if they were ourneighbors, because they are"
302, To appreciate their life stories the same way we expect them to appreciate ours
303,"They want us to knock oﬀ the noise and focus on building better, stronger communities from one end of theBay State to the other"
304,Me too
305,"And honestly, when I think about what I’ll miss most come this time next year, it will be that opportunity tocontinue to partner with so many of the great people in this room"
306,  And with the great people across thisamazing state
307, Who want nothing more than to leave it better than they found it for those who come afterthem
308,"But before that time comes, we have a responsibility do just that for the next twelve months"
309,Let’s get to work

0,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining me today"
1,"  Thank you Senate President Courtney, after more than 40 years of public service, your imprint on Oregon will not be forgotten"
2," Congratulations to new House Speaker Dan Rayfield, and a warm welcome to all of our new legislators — you are in for quite a ride"
3,"  It is my incredible honor to, one last time, follow our tradition of addressing Oregonians at the start of the legislative session, and lay out the critical issues facing our state and how we are working to address them"
4,  I stand here today at a pivotal moment for Oregon
5," Since I took office seven years ago, the world has fundamentally changed"
6, Oregon has undoubtedly faced some of the most challenging times in our state’s history: the beginning of a global pandemic
7," Wildfire seasons that have increased in intensity, with devastating impacts to match"
8," Historic floods, ice storms and heat waves brought on by a worsening climate crisis"
9, And divisions that have deepened across our country in ways we have never experienced before
10,"   Despite these difficult times, Oregon has also fundamentally changed for the better"
11, We have accomplished some incredible work over the past few years
12, We’ve shaken up the status quo
13," Oregonians — more than ever — have come together to weather these storms, and our state is better for it"
14,   Our economy is stronger than it was before the pandemic
15,   Family incomes are on the rise
16,  The unemployment rate is near record lows
17,"   And as we continue to recover from the pandemic, together, we are building a just and equitable Oregon"
18,"  Collaboration, a deep love for Oregon, and our collective determination to continue making our state a better place for everyone have led to our successes every step of the way"
19,"   Just a few months ago, I sat in a conference room with representatives from Oregon’s timber and environmental industries"
20, These two groups could not be more opposed
21," For fifty years, they have been challenging one another with ballot initiatives and fights in the Legislature"
22, The “Timber Wars” of Oregon are not an urban legend; they were real
23,"   The meetings I convened in October were the product of more than two years of work to chart a collaborative path toward meaningful, science-based forest management"
24,"   I remember showing up for that final week of negotiations thinking that my team, as the facilitators to these conversations, had pushed the discussions to the limits"
25," Even at 10:30 on that Friday night, I honestly wasn’t sure if everybody would be driving home empty handed"
26,"   Sure enough, in the early hours of the morning, these Oregonians came together and reached an agreement"
27," As one of them said, “There’s no reason to fight forever on these issues"
28,”  That doesn’t serve anyone
29,"  1  The result? A historic agreement to update the Forest Practices Act that will ensure Oregon continues to have healthy forests, fish and wildlife, as well as economic growth for our forest industry and rural communities"
30, Issues of paramount importance to all of us who call Oregon home
31,  It is the perfect example of the “Oregon Way” — coming together and finding common ground
32, Innovating to build resilience
33, All in service to the state we love
34,"   Over and over, I’ve seen the power of collaboration and innovation during my time as Governor"
35,"   •  We increased the graduation rates for Oregon kids by 8%, and while it took almost 30 years, we finally invested in our education system"
36," The Student Success Act is making targeted investments in K-12 schools, with the goal of helping our kids graduate from high school with a plan for their future and the tools to compete in a global economy"
37," •  And to invest in an education system that truly serves Oregon children from cradle to career, we expanded early learning programs as well, so that more rural families, families of color, and those with low incomes would have access to Pre-K in the critical early years of brain development"
38," • •  We have reduced the number of children in foster care by 11% to just over 5,000 kids — our lowest number in 16 years — by investing dollars to connect families with resources earlier and more effectively"
39," In 2001, then-Senator Bev Clarno and I co-sponsored Senate Bill 770, which codified our government-to-government relationships with the nine federally recognized Tribes"
40,"  As Governor, I’ve worked with tribal leaders to strengthen these relationships, so Oregonians can continue to learn from the people who have inhabited this special place since time immemorial"
41," •  We passed the state’s largest transportation package, making a 10-year investment in Oregon’s roads, rail, bridges and ports"
42," •  Now, more than 95% of Oregonians and 100% of our children have access to health care coverage"
43," And because of our state’s commitment to equity, we continued coverage during the pandemic to ensure access to quality health care during a time when people needed it most"
44,"  •  We also led the nation by passing the most comprehensive reproductive health legislation in the country, expanding access to reproductive health services for all Oregonians"
45," •  During an era when state after state is rolling back voting rights, we were the first in the nation to pass our automatic voter registration bill, serving as a model of voter access for the country"
46,"  And yet, we had no idea how important collaboration and innovation would be until COVID-19 changed everything"
47,"  We have over 5,000 COVID infections and more than 1,000 people with COVID in our hospitals today — this is the impact in Oregon of the Omicron wave that has swept the world"
48," And while this is indeed one of our more difficult chapters of the pandemic, Oregon continues to prevail"
49,"  From its onset, managing the pandemic has required aggressive and decisive actions to preserve the health and safety of our communities"
50, And Oregonians stepped up for each other to truly make a difference
51, Thank you
52,  2  I’m so pleased to see the “Oregon Way” with the Legislature as well
53," I called five special sessions since the pandemic hit to address critical issues like providing assistance for our businesses, balancing the state budget, and getting urgent rent relief out the door for families in need"
54,"  Quite frankly, because of our work together, Oregon has fared better than most"
55, •  We remain third in the nation for lowest cumulative case counts
56," If our response to COVID matched that of the average state, more than 4,000 Oregonians wouldn’t be with us today"
57, •  We continue to be among the top states for getting shots in arms and administering boosters
58, •  And all three branches of government came together to get money to renters in need
59," In less than a year, we have helped more than 90,000 Oregonians stay safely in their homes"
60,   That’s not to say it hasn’t been hard
61, It has been utterly heartbreaking at times
62, We’ve buried friends and family
63, Our kids have suffered through remote learning
64," Our home grown small businesses, which are the heart and soul of Oregon’s economy, navigated challenges unlike ever before"
65, We’ve missed precious moments visiting with grandparents and other vulnerable loved ones
66,"   However, even with all we’ve lost, we can see a path forward"
67,  We have an opportunity before us
68," Our economy is strong, and we must keep it humming"
69," Most importantly, we have to make sure that every Oregonian feels it"
70,"  While our unemployment rate is nearly as low as it was before the pandemic, too many Oregonians have struggled to find good paying careers"
71, Employers are having difficulty hiring
72,"   There are glimmers of hope, like higher wages for those hardest hit by COVID"
73," But, we also know that more and more workers are dissatisfied with their jobs, and too many are facing burnout"
74,"   In order to make transformational change in our state, we need to lift up the communities that have been left behind"
75,"   And let’s be honest, the families who have faced discrimination and barriers to economic opportunity for generations"
76," Simply due to who they are, where they live, or the color of their skin"
77,"  In my last year as Governor, I view every day, every moment, as one more opportunity to focus on the big and bold work we still have to do"
78, For Oregon’s working families
79,   I am dedicated to building a strong workforce for Oregon
80,  I will bolster that workforce by providing access to child care so that parents can go to work knowing their kids are cared for
81,    3 And I will marshal my colleagues to once again make a significant investment in affordable housing
82,   These three investments work together to ensure every working family can thrive
83,"  As always, my eyes are set on giving our children a future that is brighter than the one we inherited from our parents"
84,"  And, it is not lost upon me that we also have a unique moment, right now, to leverage record resources and funding to achieve this vision"
85,   Let’s get this done
86,"   Building a strong future for our kids and working families means removing the roadblocks that prevent them from reaching their full potential, and putting the pieces in place to build fulfilling careers"
87,   High wage careers — not just “jobs
88,”  Every single employer I talk to is having a hard time hiring the workers they need
89," You can literally see and hear this — with “now hiring” signs hanging in store windows, and stories of interviews conducted on the spot"
90,"   In the spring of 2020, I launched my Racial Justice Council to center our work in the voices of those most impacted by systemic and institutional racism"
91, What became very clear was that an underlying theme touched every single issue the RJC focused on: our workforce system was broken
92," Even today, in the middle of Oregon’s strong economic recovery, the doors of opportunity remain closed for too many families––particularly Black, Indigenous, Latino, Latina, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, Tribal and people of color; people with low incomes; and those living in rural communities"
93,"  But the truth is, herein lies an opportunity: to connect Oregon’s people to Oregon’s jobs"
94,"  So, I directed my team to work with the Racial Justice Council, as well as business leaders and workers, to develop a comprehensive package that would seize this moment and open up pathways to a workforce of the future; one that reflects the face of Oregon and meets the needs of our communities, businesses and industries"
95,"   Future Ready Oregon is a $200 million package that invests in job training with a focus on three key industries in need of skilled workers: health care, tech and manufacturing, and construction"
96,"   However, we must do more than give people particular job skills"
97, At the heart of Future Ready Oregon is the idea of “earn and learn
98,” We need to help Oregonians create a career ladder
99," We need to take an entry-level job, like a Certified Nursing Assistant, and provide the skills to advance to careers in paramedicine, nursing, or health care administration"
100, That’s turning a job into a career
101,"   4 Future Ready Oregon will help people like Ada (ah-da), who was born and raised in Astoria"
102," Ada loves the water, loves working on Oregon’s beautiful coast, and plans to become a maritime engineer, helping build ships"
103,"     Growing up, Ada’s household was just her and her mom"
104," When her mother was forced out of work due to an injury, Ada needed to start working to support their household"
105," Picking up night shifts at a local cannery, she struggled to balance her high school and trade work — all while working hard to make rent and pay the bills"
106," She often got little-to-no sleep, and she found herself with almost no time to complete her homework"
107, So Ada went to the GED program advisors at Clatsop Community College and explained her situation
108,"     They connected her with Oregon’s Youth Development Division and NW Oregon Works, and with their support, she was able to both earn her GED, and learn new skills in her trade, all while gaining access to rent assistance and a computer to complete her school work"
109,   Earning that GED set Ada on the course to achieving her dreams
110," She is now a student in a Seamanship Program, learning the skills needed to truly take her career to the next level as a maritime engineer"
111,"   In Ada’s own words: “Being a first generation student, daughter of an immigrant mother, the hope I was given was extremely appreciated"
112,"”   The building blocks of Future Ready Oregon can be summarized in three key investments:  First, we will surge an immediate $92 million to the programs we know are currently working — like Constructing Hope, which helps Oregonians get back on their feet with no-cost construction training and career advancement support"
113,"  Second, we will drive innovation through flexible grants to community-based organizations that uniquely target the industries I just mentioned"
114," Like OCHIN, who is providing technology training for people in their own communities with a goal of placing them in good-paying jobs in health care"
115," Centered in equity, this program meets people where they’re at, whether you are a single parent, veteran, or a person living with a disability"
116, This is a win-win
117,"   And last, we know Oregonians cannot be successful and productive in our economy without meeting their basic needs, like stable housing and child care"
118, We will be launching navigators across the state to make sure Oregonians in our job training programs have what they need to succeed
119, That could mean financial help with school tuition
120, It could mean providing software programs to help someone complete their coursework
121, It could be assistance with transportation or housing
122, We are asking Oregonians: What do you need to stay on your career path and land that good-paying job? We will help
123,"  Done right, Future Ready Oregon will set us on a course to greater prosperity and equity for all"
124,    One thing we know people need in order to get back to work is consistent and accessible child care
125, Child care is a basic necessity –– it is just as critical to our economic recovery as infrastructure
126," For working parents, child care is infrastructure"
127," That’s why, alongside Future Ready Oregon, I’m working with the Legislature to pass a $100 million investment that will expand child care access to serve more families, and provide professional learning opportunities and higher compensation to develop and retain our providers"
128," I will also continue  5 to advocate for additional federal investments in our youngest, so we can ensure that every family has access and every single child has care"
129,"  Even with these investments, we also know one of the greatest barriers to showing up to work, or sending your kids to school, is dealing with the impacts of houselessness"
130, It is a vicious cycle that must end — one that requires good paying jobs and affordable housing
131,   You can see the housing crisis everywhere in Oregon — from Coos Bay to Ontario and back again
132,"   Since 2000, single family home prices have tripled in Portland"
133, Rent in Portland has gone up 25% in the last five years alone
134, But this is not just a Portland issue
135," Statewide, nearly half of all renters pay more than a third of their income to rent"
136,"   With supply not keeping up with demand, the home-buying market has become a feeding frenzy of cash offers and bidding wars well above asking price"
137," Would-be first time homeowners are priced out of homeownership, putting more pressure on rentals"
138," In downtown Portland, million-dollar condos rise on the same city blocks where people huddle over open fires to stay warm"
139,  There is no avoiding the fact that these two issues are undeniably linked –– a lack of affordable housing and some of the highest rates of people experiencing homelessness
140," In Oregon, today, missing one paycheck can be the difference between going to bed in a home with heat and running water, or sleeping unsheltered"
141,"  We have invested more in affordable housing, homelessness prevention, and rental assistance in my tenure as Governor than any other administration"
142," With our local partners, we paid out more than $400 million in rental assistance last year alone to keep more than 36,000 families housed"
143," We have approached unprecedented challenges with innovative solutions –– like Project Turnkey, a collaborative effort to turn hotels into safe shelter space"
144,"  And yet, as we can all see, it is still just a drop in the bucket"
145," We know that on any given night more than 15,000 people remain without a home in Oregon –– and more than half of them are living unsheltered"
146," In every tent you see –– in a city park, under a highway overpass, along a river –– is a person — a person who deserves a warm, safe, dry place to call home"
147,  I will level with you: Housing affordability and homelessness are not issues we can solve overnight
148," This crisis has been decades in the making, and in the last two years it has only worsened due to the pandemic and natural disasters"
149," Thankfully, we have strong partnerships with local governments and a broad range of community-based organizations to implement solutions we know can help"
150,"   And with the resources we currently have available at the state and local level, we have an opportunity to make a real difference"
151,   There’s an old saying in politics: Don’t tell me what your values are
152," Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what your values are"
153,"  This session, I am asking the Legislature to join me in supporting an additional $400 million investment in affordable housing"
154,   6 Because we have so much more work left to do
155,  Let me tell you about one person who is doing the work: Misti
156," A few years ago, Misti left an unsafe home in Klamath Falls, so that her three teenage boys could grow up in a safer environment"
157,"   At the same time, she was struck with severe medical issues, undergoing several major surgeries that left her unable to work"
158,"   Unfortunately, Misti lost her apartment, and bounced from one place to the next"
159," Time and again, she ran into bureaucratic barriers and people who didn’t understand the trauma she had experienced"
160," Even while homeless, she kept her kids in school, and eventually connected with a community action agency and caseworker"
161," One step at a time, she found a home, took classes, got her GED"
162," Today, she is a case manager helping veterans, wildfire survivors, and others experiencing homelessness in Klamath and Lake Counties"
163,"   As we make investments in housing and services to prevent homelessness, we’re investing in people like Misti"
164," From her own experience of homelessness, to helping other people back into homes of their own"
165,    Addressing this crisis is not just about investing resources
166," It’s about fixing a system that has been rigged against working families, particularly families of color"
167, We must keep our eyes fixed on the deep racial disparities in housing stability and homeownership caused by decades –– centuries –– of racism in housing policies in this country
168,"  And, we must address the intersection of housing and health needs"
169," Expanding access to behavioral health services and substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery is critical"
170, I will continue to partner with the Legislature to finalize significant investments in behavioral health this year
171,"  This, all of this, is the work we must carry forward, in my last year, and under the next administration"
172, And we must continue to act with urgency
173,"  If the housing crisis is the most pressing issue in our communities today, then climate change is the crisis that threatens our very way of life — today, tomorrow, and for generations to come"
174," As leaders, we are charged with leaving our children a better world than the one we inherited"
175,"   If we are truly honest with ourselves, that is not the trajectory we find our planet on right now"
176," If you’ve sat down recently with young climate leaders, like I have, they will tell you so to your face"
177,   Every year I have been Governor we have seen more extreme weather than the last
178," We have experienced unprecedented devastation, from historic drought, to expansive flooding, to a deadly heat dome and massive power outages from winter storms"
179, And the effects of every one of these extreme weather events were felt across the Oregon landscape
180, Climate change is a hammer hitting us in the head
181,"  Over the past two years, we’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars and called upon Oregonians to help one another prepare for, respond to, and recover from climate-related disasters"
182," Thank you to our National Guard, local police, and fire teams who helped evacuate  7 people during emergencies, and our first responders for stepping up"
183," We are grateful that you all answered our call for help, but I wish you didn’t have to"
184,"  We must act now, decisively, to lower carbon emissions, transition to clean energy sources, and ensure a just transition for our historically-underserved communities"
185,"   Because I’ve seen firsthand how climate change directly impacts our people, our family businesses, and Oregon’s iconic produce"
186,  I am proud of the progress Oregon has made since I became Governor
187,"   We have led the nation in proving it is possible to address climate change and grow our economy, at the same time"
188,"   In 2020, Oregon closed our last coal power plant — decades ahead of schedule"
189, We have created a comprehensive approach to tackling the climate crisis that can serve as a model for others around the globe
190, We have set targets to reduce our carbon emissions
191, We’ve established one of the most aggressive timelines in the nation for transitioning to 100% clean energy sources
192, And we have expanded rebates and access for electric vehicles and infrastructure
193,  What I’m most proud of is how Oregon approaches these challenges––through an equity lens
194," With a focus on our communities hardest hit by climate change: rural communities, people with low incomes, and people of color"
195,   We’ve come together before to make investments like the ones I just outlined
196, And those investments are a big part of the reason that Oregon was able to weather the last two years of turmoil better than most of the country
197, No one needs any proof that investments like these work
198, We just need the will to put our differences aside and focus on that which is greater than ourselves — and greater than our political aspirations
199, For the success of our state and everyone living in it
200,"   As I enter my last year as Governor, I still have moments where it feels surreal to have sat in this office and guided our state through a global pandemic"
201," While COVID-19 may have defined these times, it doesn’t need to define our lives"
202,    Oregonians have worked together to prevent the worst impacts of this virus
203," Now, we must transition from a rolling crisis into a sustainable posture that supports our workers, businesses, and health care industry"
204,"   I have always believed that it is the Governor’s job — and government’s role — to serve every Oregonian, no matter who they are, where they come from, or how they vote"
205, That is our job as public servants
206,"   As leaders, we’re charged with leaving the world a better place than we’ve inherited"
207," As adults, we strive to pass the torch to our kids so they can succeed as the next generation on a higher plane of life"
208,"  These will not be the last challenges our state faces, but I sure hope those that follow can learn from how we navigated them"
209,  8  To all the future Governors of our state
210, To the elected leaders who will come next
211," To our future business and community leaders, and youth who will follow our footsteps"
212," Let me leave you with this: find the opportunity, even in times of crisis"
213," Especially, in times of crisis"
214,   That’s how we continue on this journey of transformational change for Oregon
215, That’s how we pursue justice
216, That’s how we heal divides and collaborate in ways that serve our state
217, That’s how we honor this beautiful place we call home
