3,govGovernor Glenn Youngkin DeliversAddress to the Joint AssemblyAs prepared for Delivery Good afternoon
4,"Standing here before you, and looking around this room, I’m struck by thehistory that’s been made in this place, the people’s house"
5,As well as the fact that the work you do here has great consequence for thepeople of Virginia
6, And so it is as we gather here today
7,Governor of VirginiaGlenn YoungkinMr
8," Speaker, Madam President, Lt"
9," Governor Earle-Sears, Chief JusticeGoodwyn, and Justices of the Supreme Court, members of the GeneralAssembly, my fellow Virginians, today we begin anew, all of us together"
10,"After years of fractured politics, a deadly pandemic, lives and livelihoods lost,soaring mental health incidents and drug overdoses, rising crime rates, ever-increasing costs for housing, food and fuel, Virginians have sent us here toturn the page"
11,They came out in record numbers to make their voice heard
12, They chose anew vision for the future
13,"Today, I want to speak to that vision and begin our partnership to address thepriorities of the people"
14,I’ve enjoyed getting to know so many of the members of these two legislativebodies both Republicans and Democrats
15,You have invited me to your homes
16, We’ve shared meals together
17, We’vedone community service together
18, And I thank you for that
19,We’re all part of Team Virginia
20,"And as I shared on Saturday, we can take inspiration from Dr"
21," Martin LutherKing’s life which we celebrate today and his words that “we may have allcome on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now"
22,"”The work we have to do, we must do together"
23,"And there isn’t a better example of people coming together on behalf ofVirginia than the brave crews, the law enforcement heroes, and the firstresponders who worked during yesterday’s storm in the freezing cold, ice andsnow to keep our streets safe, the lights on and our hospitals open"
24,"Before I speak to the work ahead, I want to recognize someone who hastraveled with me every step of the way"
25,She inspired me to live a life of faith as a younger man
26, She is an example ofhumility and strength not just to our children but to women across this greatcommonwealth
27,"She is the best partner I could ever imagine our First Lady, SuzanneYoungkin"
28,"After a year of campaigning at diners, senior centers, schools, housingprojects, courthouses…even pickup basketball games, I’ve taken the measureof our people"
29,"I’ve found them to be resilient, optimistic, courageous"
30, I listened to theirhopes and concerns their dreams and fears
31, Their stories of inspiration andstories of tragedy
32,Some cried on my shoulders
33, Some prayed over me
34, And some spoke bluntlymaybe a little too bluntly at times
35,Almost all expressed a desire for a Virginia worthy of the ambitions of itspeople
36,I come here today to echo their clarion call for change
37,To form a government that works for ordinary citizens
38, That’s a catalyst foropportunity and not an obstacle
39, And that addresses the kitchen tableconcerns of working families that are real and mounting
40,It’s been said that all great change starts at kitchen tables across America
41,"You see, that’s where families talk about what matters to them"
42, It’s also whereparents discuss their worries stagnant wages in the face of rising expensescaring for an elderly parent and trying to find a way to save for their kids’future
43,I want to share with you something that we’ve all heard from voters
44,They’re genuinely concerned that the cold halls of government aredisconnected from the cold realities families face while sitting at their kitchentables every day
45,"In that respect, we shouldn’t misconstrue record revenue for government aseconomic success for Virginians"
46,"The view from the people, whose labor generates those tax receipts is quitedifferent than the talk in Richmond"
47,They see an economy whose growth has stalled at less than 1% per year for 8years
48, With household incomes stagnating over the last year --- as the costof living has sky-rocketed
49,"They see declining schools, they see violent crime reports dominating thenews, they see record low labor participation, they see small businessesstruggling, and they see government failures and encroachments on theirliberties"
50,From the perspective of every day Virginia families times are tough
51, And thestate of our Commonwealth is not what it should be
52,Today we’re at the proverbial “tipping point” where the cash flow to thegovernment from rising tax burdens is very high
53,"And yet the impact of high costs and high taxes, and an increased regulatoryburden are clearly being felt in the real economy and the real lives ofVirginians"
54,The good news is that we have the ability to course-correct before this poorperformance becomes permanent
55,With current and projected tax driven surpluses we can lower the tax burdenson Virginia families
56,"And make crucial investments in those critical pillars to the great Virginiapromise of a lower cost-of-living, excellent schools, safe communities, a rip-roaring economy that lifts up all Virginians, and a state government thatworks for Virginians"
57,"To do that, I’m asking each of us in this body Republican and Democrat aliketo come together"
58,"To rise above the Richmond of divisive, special interest politics, the small andthe parochial to usher in a sweeping vision of changeAnd to put this commonwealth on a pathway to prosperity"
59,"On day one, we hit the ground running, signing 11 executive actions, andswearing in a full cabinet, outstanding individuals, who are qualified andshare Virginia’s values"
60,"As of today, we’ve worked with legislators to introduce 59 pieces oflegislation to tackle our day one agenda"
61,And we’ll be submitting a package of 25 budget amendments to reflect ourbipartisan priorities
62,We’re addressing issues that are critical to the future of this commonwealth
63,And that every member in this chamber can get behind
64,Virginians have given us a license to lead
65, They have charged us all to deliveron a Day One agenda
66,We know on some issues there’ll be deep disagreement
67,But I believe this chamber is big enough for us to talk through ourdifferences
68, And there is more that binds us than divides us
69,For we all share a common goal to leave a better Virginia for our children
70,We’re going to start by investing in Virginia classrooms
71,Education is the key to opportunity
72, The means by which all children and theirparents can realize their greatest dreams
73,Virginia schools have a lofty reputation
74, But lately we’ve not lived up to thatreputation
75,"In fact, our education standards for math and reading are now the lowest inthe nation"
76,Unelected political appointees lowered standards which inevitably led to adecline in student performance
77,"60% of our students don’t meet national proficiency standards, including over70% of Latino students, and over 80% of black students, failing to meetstandard on the math NAEP tests"
78," Remarkably, despite these dramaticdeclines noted by the National Center for Education Statistics only oneVirginia school has been deemed failingbecause accreditation standards were lowered"
79,Starting now we’re ending the accountability shell games intended to makeus feel good but amount to the often stated “soft bigotry of lowexpectations
80,”Let’s stop cheating our kids
81,On this we should join arms and purpose together so that when our time hereis done we’ll collectively have raised education standards from the lowest tothe highest in the nation
82,I’m also calling for $150 million to help us meet our goal of starting 20 newcharter schools
83,"Whether they’re called charter schools, lab schools, or schools of innovation– it doesn’t really matter"
84,I don’t care what we call it I just care that we do it
85,We’re joined today by the students of Green Run Collegiate Charter School inVirginia Beach
86, Green Run Collegiate shares a facility with Green Run HighSchool
87,They have an innovative curriculum
88, They provide access to every child in theschool district to attend the collegiate program
89, They’re thriving and theirparents are thrilled
90,Please join me in welcoming these future Virginia leaders to ourcommonwealth’s capitol
91,We’re going to build partnerships between the commonwealth and our greatuniversities to create lab schools of excellence
92,It could be a lab school in Southwest Virginia in partnership with UVA Wise
93,It could be an entrepreneurship or entertainment industry-focused schoolpartnering with one of our amazing historically black colleges anduniversities
94,Or a partnership with Old Dominion University for opportunities in offshorewind development or maritime projects
95,"When it comes to the education budget, I’ve heard consistent bipartisanagreement from all of you that the budget you’ll pass, and that I’ll sign willreflect a record investment in education including a significant boost inteacher pay"
96,With the exception of a parent or guardian no one impacts the future of ayoung child more than a quality teacher
97,We will attract quality professionals to Virginia schools
98, And we will payteachers as the professionals they are
99,We must also recognize that the people most responsible for a child’seducation are parents
100,"My message to parents is this,You have a fundamental right, enshrined in law by this General Assembly, tomake decisions with regard to your child’s upbringing, education and care"
101,And we will protect and reassert that right
102,"Hear me clearly when parents are empowered and engaged, a child’s life isenhanced"
103,I’ve heard the concerns of parents about curriculum
104,"Virginia parents want our history – all of our history, the good and the bad tobe taught"
105," And they want their children to be told how to think, not what tothink"
106,That’s why we should not use inherently divisive concepts like Critical RaceTheory in Virginia
107, And why we should not be teaching our children to seeeverything through the lens of race
108,That’s also why I want to give parents the right to be informed before theirchild is exposed to sexually explicit materials
109,"Please, send me the same bill you passed on a bipartisan basis in 2017 and Iwill sign it"
110,"The classroom environment must be safe, so children can learn"
111,I’m asking members of this general assembly to prioritize school safety byputting a school resource officer on every campus
112,I also ask you to join me in protecting students from sex traffickingorganizations that recruit them on and off campus
113,Let’s train educators to see the signs of trafficking
114, And to stand in the gapfor children at risk of being preyed upon
115,Let’s also involve local law enforcement agencies in the approval of schoolsafety audits
116,And whenever someone preys upon a child in a Virginia school --- we mustrequire it to be reported to local law enforcement for investigation
117,No more cover-ups
118, No more sweeping it under the rug
119, Parents deserve toknow if their child is at risk
120,"Schools exist for the educational benefit of children, and for that reason theymust remain open"
121," I strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated forCovid-19, and get the booster"
122,"As we battle covid, its parents that should decide the health measures takenfor their children"
123,That is why I signed an executive order that allows parents to opt out of maskmandates in schools
124, This is a matter of individual liberty
125,"Again, this body passed a law that protects parent’s fundamental right tomake decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of theirchildren"
126,And health care workers should get to make those decisions too
127,And I will continue to oppose President Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate forhealth workers as we continue to fight a crisis of staffing in Virginia’shealthcare system
128,"Our fight against COVID 19 will move forward based on this simple principlewe will protect lives and livelihoods"
129,That means no more mandates and no more shut downs
130, As I said onSaturday it means Virginia is open for business
131,It also means the science since the beginning of the pandemic has not beenstatic
132, We now have therapeutics better testing protocols and fortunately aless severe variant
133,And of course we have vaccines
134," It means, educating our friends andneighbors and encouraging them to get the vaccine and the booster"
135,There are 1
136,6 million unvaccinated Virginians today
137,"And speaking to you as your Governor, I’ll never tell you what you must do"
138,But speaking to you as a friend and a neighbor I strongly encourage you toget the vaccine
139,The data is clear people who do not get the vaccine are four times as likely tobe hospitalized
140,"The vaccine will not only help keep people out of the hospital, it will also keeppeople working, earning a paycheck and growing our economy, somethingthat has to remain a top priority for us all"
141,Our Day One Plan will jump-start jobs
142,We’re going to repeal needless regulations
143, We’re going to invest in jobtraining
144, We’re going to foster innovation
145, And we’re going to win thecompetition for jobs and corporate re-locations
146,I support a significant investment in mega-sites
147,"To make sure we don’t lose the next advanced battery manufacturing plantafter seeing several go to Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia"
148,And while we’re at it let’s broaden the baseball stadium authority to includefootball
149, And perhaps we’ll get one of those too
150,I want our rural Virginians to know we’re spreading prosperity far and wide
151,And rural Virginia won’t be left behind
152,"We’re not only bringing jobs, we’re bringing high-speed broadband"
153,Every governor for the last decade has stood in this chamber and told youthat rural broadband was a priority
154, This time we’re going to get it done
155,We’re also going to make certain that key projects at our ports and ourhighways are completed
156,"So the message is clear, if your cargo container ships is stuck off the coast ofanother state come to Virginia"
157,We’re ready for your business
158, And we won’t make supply chain problemsworse with regulatory red tape
159,"And let me be clear, I believe in the fundamental right to work"
160,If anyone tries to bring me a bill that creates forced unionization it will meetthe business end of my veto pen
161,"The states around us have created more jobs, grown their economies faster,and took steps years ago that we must take now, lower taxes, business-friendly regulations, workforce development and more"
162,"This is a real competition, and to win, we have to “play to win"
163,”One of the other challenges businesses face especially small businesses isthe high cost of providing health care for their employees
164,"Over the last three years, you sent the governor eight versions of anassociation health plan bill to make it easier for workers to get health care"
165,It was vetoed eight times
166, Pass that bill again and I will sign it
167,"Virginians are struggling with the high cost of living, in a commonwealth withskyrocketing housing costs, rising fuel prices, and the silent wage theft ofinflation"
168,There are economic fundamentals we don’t control in Virginia – that must bedealt with at the federal level
169,But Washington continues to fiddle in the face of real supply chainchallenges
170, And allows our nation to be overly-reliant on China for criticalgoods and services
171,But there is one vital thing we can do to help Virginians
172," And that is removesome of the tax burden --- added on top of rising prices for groceries,gasoline and housing"
173,That’s why I support suspending the recent gas tax increase for a year andfully eliminating the grocery tax immediately
174,There’s bipartisan support for eliminating the grocery tax
175," Together, we willgive Virginians real relief"
176,We also need to give Virginians a real break on their personal income tax bydoubling the standard deduction
177, And providing the largest tax rebate inVirginia history
178,These tax cuts benefit the people who need it the most
179,"And represent the largest tax relief ever given to the people of Virginia $1,500this year for the typical Virginia family"
180,"But beyond the economic implications of this package, I believe we have aspecial obligation to a group of individuals that have served our country withdistinction our military veterans"
181,Those who risk life and limb for country and community don’t do it for thepay
182, They do it because service is in their blood
183,"The care and support of our veterans, have always transcended partisanpolitics"
184,That’s why I’m asking this General Assembly to act on something long talkedabout
185,"Let’s eliminate the tax on the first $40,000 in military retirement pay together"
186,Anyone who wears the uniform risks their life each day on the job
187," And thisincludes police officers, firefighters, EMTs, every first responder that keepsus safe"
188,We’re in a fractious era and no group of individuals is under greater scrutinytoday than our law enforcement
189,A culture of lawlessness has filled the void in Virginia with violent crime onthe rise
190,"In November, Police Officer Michael Chandler of the Big Stone Gap PoliceDepartment was violently gunned down by a vicious criminal"
191,Incidents like this are all too common today
192,We’ll never know the depth of his loss to his family but we grieve with themand pray for them
193,"In Virginia, we must stand with our law enforcement agencies"
194," And therefore,I’m asking you to fund our police to protect our communities"
195,Officer Michael Chandler’s widow --- Natasha Chandler is also a member oflaw enforcement
196," She’s a Wise County Deputy Sheriff who even after losingher husband, insisted on returning to serve"
197,She’s watching this afternoon
198,"Please join me in recognizing the sacrifice that her husband, Michael, madeon our behalf"
199,"The budget submitted to this General Assembly includes pay raises fortroopers, sheriffs’ deputies and corrections officers"
200,Those are strong first steps I know we all support
201,But we need to provide more funding for our police departments
202, And morefunding for training and equipment
203,"Together, we should dedicate $100 million in ARPA funds to a training andequipment grant program for law enforcement"
204, And provide capital fundingfor a new state police training facility
205,"Furthermore, I’m asking you to dedicate $26 million in state funding for policedepartments"
206, But only in localities that are increasing funding for their policedepartments
207,We’ll also fund community violence intervention by dedicating at least $5million to Operation Cease Fire
208,It’s time to take down the temperature around discussions of policing
209,The solution is constructive engagement and dialogue
210, Not inadequatefunding which creates more lawlessness
211,"And when it comes to lawlessness, I want to be crystal clear"
212,If we won’t tolerate it in communities across the commonwealth then wecertainly won’t tolerate it within a state agency
213,"On Saturday, I fired the entire parole board"
214,And I asked Attorney General Miyares to begin an investigation into whathappened there
215,"The violations of law and the Constitution, the unconscionable refusal tonotify families, of victims about pending decisions to release murderers, weresimply unacceptable"
216,We will not accept selective violations of our constitutional rights
217, We willprotect all of them
218,We don’t get to pick and choose the parts of the Constitution we want topreserve and protect
219,"In order for our government to work for the people, we must also reform theinstitutions of government that fail to serve the people"
220,I’ll admit I’ve never run a government agency
221, But I know something aboutrunning a business
222,And we’re going to bring business efficiency to government bureaucracy
223,That’s why I appointed a Commonwealth Chief Transformation Officer --- tooversee government transformation
224,"We will make government more responsive, more efficient, and moretransparent and we’ll start by fixing the Department of Motor Vehicles andthe Virginia Employment Commission"
225,"Furthermore, we will be innovative in leveraging federal transportation fundsto address the challenges of growth and gridlock"
226,"In Virginia, we are going to build roads, bridges, rail lines and utility lines"
227,We are going to be better prepared for weather events that strain ourhighways and the electric grid
228,And we will marshal our resources to make our infrastructure the mostreliable in the nation
229,"As I travel Virginia, I remain in awe of the raw natural beauty of ourCommonwealth"
230,"The mountains, waterways, beaches, parks, farm land, livestock, vineyards,and natural resources testify to our Creator’s artistry"
231,I deeply treasure the natural beauty of Virginia
232, And my administration willdedicate itself to protecting and promoting it as a core principle of ourservice
233,That’s why we will end the dumping of raw sewage in the James River onceand for all
234,I also support fully funding best management practices on our farms in orderto protect our soil and water from the Chesapeake Bay to the Jackson River
235,And we are going to see the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay to the finish line
236,Coastal resiliency is critical to me
237,And it’s critical to our nation because of our Port and military assets inHampton Roads
238,That’s why we’re going to create the Coastal Virginia Resiliency Authority tobattle rising seas and make sure the federal government does its part too
239,Let me state our goal
240,Let’s work together in partnership
241, To build a government as virtuous as ourpeople
242, One that serves
243,You don’t have to look too far to find examples of that spirit among thepeople of Virginia
244,"I met a veteran of our military on the campaign trail by the name of NatashaBarijon  BEAR-ee-un)"
245,She’s an immigrant
246," And like so many first generation immigrants, she lovesthis country with a passion few can understand though certainly ourlieutenant governor can"
247,Natasha knows what life is like in other parts of the world
248,Which is why tears flowed down her face when she told me about her journeyto America her pride in serving in our military and the hopes and dreams shehas for her daughter to grow up in a better America
249,Natasha represents the best of America
250,She may not have been born here but she is every bit American as someonewho was
251, Because she has lived the ideals of this great land
252,Natasha is also watching today
253,Please join me in recognizing her service to our country and her dreams forher daughter
254,Virginia is home to heroes
255, Many living and many who lie in eternal rest
256,"I attended the funeral of one such hero last month, in Virginia Beach – theCommanding Officer of SEAL Team 8, Brian Bourgeois"
257,Brian could light up a room with his laugh and he could put his subordinatesat ease during the most tense moments
258,Translations  ▼He gave his life in service to freedom
259," And he left behind a wife, Megan, andfive children"
260, One of which – Barrett – led us in the pledge of allegiance onSaturday
261,What price would we in this room put on freedom?For some freedom is so precious they would offer everything in its defense
262,Those of us who live in the freedom they so valiantly protect must live livesworthy of their sacrifice
263, Set aside petty divisions
264, Set aside ego and self-advancement
265," And join together to make this Virginia we love better, stronger,freer"
266,"My friends in this esteemed legislature, I’m inspired to be with you thisafternoon"
267, And to be working with you to build a future of limitlessopportunity and strengthen the spirit of Virginia
268,"Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the Commonwealth of Virginia"
