10," Governor, First Lady"
11,
12,
13,  Joining us today are a special group of distinguishedguests
14,
15,
16," teachers, doctors, nurses and first responders"
17, I want to sincerely thank ALL of you forjoining me under the dome of the old Illinois State Capitol building
18,"  So many of you have showeduptoworkinpersonduringtheworsthealthcrisisourstatehaseverseenIfiguredtheleastICorridors to promote new investment and bring jobs to communitiesOver $800 million for violence prevention appropriations, which will more than triple Stateviolence prevention funding since FY19"

21,  I figured the least Icould do as your Governor was brave a snow storm to deliver the State of the State Address
22," One year ago, I delivered a speech a few miles from here in the Orr Building at the StateFairgrounds as members of our Illinois National Guard readied the facility to serve as a massvaccination site"
23,"  Like all of you, I had hoped that that was the beginning of the end of one of themost challenging times our state and our nation has ever lived through"
24, But it wasn't the end
25,"  We continue even now to battle an invisible enemy that has challenged allour institutions and forced every single Illinoisan to confront deeply held convictions about family,work, education, healthcare, science and our collective responsibility to one another"
26, It would be the most human of tendencies to obsess during this time over one question: Why?  Whyare we going through this?  Why did it start
27,
28,
29,"why won't it end?  Why is this the slice of history weare being asked to carry? The answers to those questions remain elusive - and we cannot allow their pursuit to distract usfrom another more essential question: How will we distinguish ourselves and how will historyremember us during this time? According to legend, the famed cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead once delivered a lecture toher students that started with this question to her class: ""What was the earliest sign of humancivilization?"" The answers her students provided are what you might predict: tools, pots, weapons, iron,agriculture"
30, But Mead shook her head no to all these answers and instead held up a healed femur - a leg bonethat had broken and mended
31,"  She explained that this healing was the first sign of true civilizationbecause it meant someone had looked after this person - given them food, shelter and rest at greatpersonal sacrifice"
32,  Mead's argument was that true human civilization arrived when our ancestorschose to look out for one another despite personal risk or inconvenience
33, The question of what we owe our fellow humans has been front and center in my mind over the lastseveral years - but most especially the last 12 months
34,  And I keep returning to Margaret Mead'ssimple lesson - that the measure of any society is how willing we are to care for those who need us
35,The COVID-19 pandemic has presented us with a challenge the likes of which we have not seen ingenerations
36,  It has brought families to their breaking points - with parents especially struggling every day to tryand make the right decisions for their children as well as their own parents and grandparents
37, COVID has forced a true reckoning about what it means to work and what it means to live - nohkidfjbhldidEkifiiddimatter what kind of job you are holding down
38,  Every worker in every profession is demanding arethinking right now of the sacrifices they are being asked to make
39, Every working parent isnavigating how to hold Zoom calls with a toddler screaming in the background or facing theimpossible choice between going to their hourly job or staying home with a sick child
40,   And I talk to so many entrepreneurs who want to do right by their workers — at the same time theyhave to keep up with their competitors in order to survive
41,  But no one in our state has born a greater burden in the last twelve months than the nurses anddoctors and first responders who have had no respite from the unrelenting agony of the mostbrutal parts of the global pandemic
42, TO THE ILLINOIS MEDICAL COMMUNITY: I know that every career in healthcare begins withsomeone who wants to help sick people get well
43,"  I know that during the months and years youpracticed and trained for the job you hold now, you had to come to terms with the idea that youcouldn't save everyone - that some people would be too sick, some cases too hard to solve"
44,   I know you learned to cope with that inevitability by discovering the balance between joy and grief
45, I know that underneath that balance you felt the world owed you a promise to never let one side ofthat scale get too overwhelming
46,   And I know that you feel like that promise has been broken - that too much grief has robbed theprofession you have devoted your life to of all its joy
47,  I know that as you have watched yourhospitals fill with patients once again these last two months - that there is a small but persistentvoice inside of you asking you how much more you can take
48, I wish I could lift this burden from you
49,  I wish it with all my heart
50,"   But in the absence of the ability to do that - I feel it important to stand here, in the most visiblepublic forum I can think of, and say: I see you"
51,  Our entire state sees you
52,"  And while we can't takeaway your burden, we can directly acknowledge it and assist you in carrying some of it"
53,  And asGovernor I can offer you my most deep and heartfelt thanks on behalf of a grateful state
54,One thing we can all do right now is continue rising to the challenge of combatting the pandemichead on
55, And we are
56,  A larger percentage of Illinoisans have been vaccinated than in any other Midwestern state
57," Ourstate has led with equity, with the highest regional vaccination rates for our Black and Brownresidents"
58, We are the leader in vaccinating kids 5 to 17 years old
59," We've held over 7,350 mobilevaccination clinics at churches, senior centers, schools, day camps, and YMCAs to make gettingthe vaccine easier for every Illinoisan who wants it"
60,"  The battle to keep people safe from the virus isn't over, though we are more experienced atmanaging through it"
61," When the surge came last fall, we put our masks back on - and it helped keepourhospitalsfrombeingoverrunToprotectthemostvulnerablepeopleinourstate'scareIour hospitals from being overrun"
62," To protect the most vulnerable people in our states care, Irequired vaccinations at state-run congregate care facilities, including our veterans' homes andhomes for people with developmental disabilities"
63, Our schools have remained safe and open
64,"  Of the more than 850 public school districts in ourstate, fewer than a dozen have had to take an adaptive pause recently because of COVID-19"
65,"That's because we have three tools that we know work: masks, testing and vaccines"
66,"  And I havenot hesitated to use these tools and make them available to schools so they can maintain in-personlearning for Illinois' children while protecting parents, teachers, and staff"
67,"  In fact, we set thenational standard for how to safely keep kids in schools when the CDC adopted our Illinois ""test-to-stay"" model"
68," The virus has remained a threat for far longer than any of us would like, but we continue to findways to live our lives AND protect the vulnerable all at the same time"
69,The pandemic recession has taken an enormous financial toll on workers and businesses
70, Government must continue to do everything possible to help people recover
71,"  With all our effortsover the last two years — city, county, state, federal — we're seeing signs of progress every singleday"
72,  Our investments in working families and small businesses are paying off
73," Since the bottom of the pandemic recession in April of 2020, we have added 600,000 jobs andgrown the overall state GDP beyond pre-pandemic levels"
74, Illinois job growth now outpaces thenational job growth
75," Wages have increased for working class families, and jobs are available forworkers of nearly every skill"
76, Workers have bargaining power like never before
77, And businesseshave applied ingenuity and creativity to rebuild and grow and are making Illinois one of the bestplaces to do business in the country
78, Our recovery is happening because our people have an unmatched work ethic and our employersan incredible commitment to workers and the communities they serve
79,  It's also happening becausewe've focused on providing as much stability as possible for small businesses and workers andfamilies here in Illinois
80, To succeed we've had to acknowledge that working parents need childcare
81," In the early months ofthe pandemic, we launched a childcare support program that is now nationally recognized —delivering relief grants to provide a safe work environment for caregivers, and allowing childcareproviders to stay afloat during the worst of this global health crisis"
82,  We've been awarding retentionbonuses to Illinois' childcare workers
83, We're providing out-of-work parents with three months oflow-cost or free childcare so they can look for a job without worrying about their kids
84," Then we partnered with the General Assembly to award nearly $1 billion in grants to more than12,000 small businesses - covering every sector of the Illinois economy, especially those that wereleft out of the federal PPP program"
85,"  Because of it, tens of thousands of jobs in every part of ourstate were saved"
86, WealsoneededtokeepstrugglingfamiliesfrombeingforcedoutoftheirhomesbythepandemicWe also needed to keep struggling families from being forced out of their homes by the pandemicrecession
87," So with the help of Representative Delia Ramirez and Senator Omar Aquino, the IllinoisHousing Development Authority went to work, providing some of the fastest relief for landlords andtenants among all the states"
88,"  More than $1 billion has kept renters and homeowners from losingtheir housing, with hundreds of millions more to support them in the first half of 2022"
89,"  Aprohibition on COVID-related evictions, utility shutoffs, and vehicle repossessions protected thosesuffering pandemic-related hardships"
90," Throughout this deadly pandemic, I've governed with a consistent philosophy: protect the mostvulnerable, offer simple and straightforward help through the hard times, and make Illinois anexample for the rest of the country for how to manage through the crisis"
91," Because of the amazing residents of this state, we've been able to do that"
92," Within weeks of being sworn in as governor in 2019, I appeared in the front of the GeneralAssembly for the very first time with a dire report on the state of the state's finances and anoverview of the true fiscal wreckage left for us to clean up"
93,  Back then we had a $3
94,2 billion deficit
95, We had $7
96,9 billion owed in unpaid bills
97,  The state had doled out over $1
98,2 billion in late paymentpenalties
99,"  We had suffered an astonishing eight credit rating downgrades in the years 2015 to2017, and our credit hovered at just one notch above junk status"
100,   I made a promise that day
101," I said: ""Budgeting will not be done any more by taking the state hostage,or by court orders, consent decrees and continuing appropriations but instead by debate andcompromise and a return to regular order"
102, We will work together earnestly to solve the state'sproblems
103," We will disagree at times on important things, but the work we all came here to do willget done"
104,""" I believe that if we are ever going to fix what is broken in the American political system, it startswith politicians keeping their word"
105,   So let me offer an update on the promise of fiscal responsibility I made to you three years ago
106," After decades of credit downgrades, by the end of my second full fiscal year in office, Illinoisreceived two credit upgrades - the first upgrades the state has received in over 20 years"
107,"  Themassive bill backlog that contained bills past due for as long as 500 days, now contains onlyunpaid General Funds bills averaging 15 days old"
108, And that $3
109,2 billion structural deficit? Well today I'm pleased to announce Illinois will end thisfiscal year with a $1
110,"7 billion surplus, the first of its kind in more than 25 years"
111," Now, I know that the same tired old characters who are always so desperate to bad-mouth Illinoiswill falsely attribute our fiscal success to the federal American Rescue Plan Act"
112,"  As usual, they'rewrong"
113, LhdihfbdlldiihhLet me set the record straight for you — our state budget surpluses would exist even without themoney we received from the federal government
114,"  Painstaking work has been done in coordinationwith the General Assembly and Comptroller Susana Mendoza over the last 3 years to diligently andmeticulously reverse the irresponsible decisions of the past and ensure that responsible budgetingwould become the rule, not the exception"
115,"  What a self-indulgent position the cynics take, always opposing what's in the best interest of thepeople of Illinois if they think it will advance their own political standing"
116," It's a curious position - butthen again, there have long been people in Illinois state politics who have cared more aboutpromoting their own propaganda than they do about what's best for your pocketbooks"
117,"  During thisbudget cycle especially, seats at the grown-up table will be off limits to those who aren't working inthe public's best interests"
118," Back in 2019, I promised you that we would not allow political posturing by those people to againtake the state's finances hostage"
119, I ran for Governor to move beyond that
120,  And we have
121,"  If youdon't believe me, take it from the credit rating agency S&P"
122,"  In their announcement last year ofIllinois's credit upgrade they said: ""The political gridlock that stymied governance a few fiscal yearsago has dissipated"
123,""" Look, the actual work of managing Illinois' state finances is decidedly unglamorous"
124,"  It is hours ofhammering away at calcified problems of the past, persistently reducing liabilities on our state'sbalance sheet, finding and implementing efficiencies and savings, upgrading systems that trackexpenditures, and asking every government employee to be a partner in smart budgeting"
125,"  It's notpartisan work, it's not political work"
126,
127,
128,it's just hard work
129,"  It requires resisting the temptation to letpolitical expediency take over our budget process, and it demands discipline and a commitment todo what's right"
130, And that is what my administration and a majority of the General Assembly have been committed todoing — no matter how difficult the circumstances or how unprecedented the times
131,   So let's talk about good governance and what fiscal responsibility looks like
132,  During those first few terrible months of the COVID crisis - when it was unclear whether the bottomwould completely fall out of state revenues — we borrowed $3
133,2 billion from the federalgovernment so we wouldn't wonder if the state could meet the needs of people who weresuffering
134,  Not a chance I was going to allow an interruption of vital services by our hospitals or letour schools close for lack of PPE
135,"  And as soon as our state revenues rebounded, paying down ourborrowing was among my highest priorities"
136," We paid our debt back nearly 2 years early, savingtaxpayers $82 million in interest costs"
137, Then there were the short-term borrowings that date back to the budget crisis five years ago
138," Thebill backlog, that at its height reached nearly $17 billion, and the $1"
139,"5 billion borrowed from thestate treasury, have now been paid down"
140, IbliiidbI believe in paying our debts
141,"  Each year I've served as Governor, our state has met its pension payment obligations"
142," But when weare able, I think we ought to do more than just pay the minimum"
143, That's why I propose making notonly our minimum pension payment this year but also an additional half a billion dollars
144," If approved by the General Assembly, this will be the first time since the beginning of 1994 pensionfunding ramp that we will reduce our pension debt by more than our required contribution"
145, I amasking Democrats and Republicans to work together with me to get this done because it will savetaxpayers $1
146,8 billion in interest payments over the coming years
147," For longer than I can remember, the pension naysayers have told us we should ignore theconstitution and the protections it provides and instead break our promises to retirees"
148, I won't dothat
149," Instead we are tackling our pension problem with responsible pension investment decisions,solid investment returns, and expansion of the pension buyout program"
150," As a result, pensionliabilities are down, and pension assets are up"
151," There's more work to do, but pension payments asa percentage of our budget have finally flattened and are projected to decline"
152, Great news forpensioners and taxpayers alike
153,"  For years, Illinois has been without any financial cushion in the event of a downturn, and 22 monthsago we experienced how debilitating that could be"
154," Now that we've paid down our bill backlog andconsistently balanced the budget, it's time to begin restoring our state's long neglected BudgetStabilization Fund, also known as the Rainy Day Fund"
155, Right now the average state can run for 29days on its Rainy Day Fund
156," In Illinois, we can run for 15 minutes"
157,  I'm proposing that we set aside$600 million for the fund this year plus another $279 million next year
158," The past few years haveshown us that rainy days do actually arrive, and it's time to begin rebuilding protections from futurefiscal calamities"
159," At the beginning of my term, I tasked Illinois Central Management Services with taking acomprehensive look at ALL real estate holdings that Illinois has accumulated over the years - andto make an honest effort to eliminate the waste and inefficiency that had previously beenoverlooked"
160," As a result of their work, I made the decision to consolidate multiple long term leases in downtownChicago - saving taxpayers an average of approximately $20 million a year, for the next 30 years"
161,  Then there's the James R
162," Thompson Center, the least efficient building owned by the state"
163,  Fortwenty years governors have talked about selling the building — one even pretended to sell it in twoof his budget proposals
164,  I decided I would just get to work and actually sell it in real life
165,  A privatebuyer now has offered to purchase it by assuming several hundred million dollars in liabilities andpaying the state $70 million in cash
166,"  Altogether, the net savings for state taxpayers approachesthree quarters of a billion dollars — and the city of Chicago will get a brand-new, revenue-producing, renovated property in the heart of downtown"
167," OllihhiliillhddIlliiffibOverall, with this real estate restructuring we will have reduced Illinois government office space byover 640,000 square feet by 2024 and lowered the cost of leasing Chicago office space from $41 asquare foot to just $20 a square foot"
168," This is an example of how we're bringing operational improvements to state government to reducewaste, inefficiency, and liabilities"
169,  Here's another example of past mismanagement we're repairing
170, College Illinois was a programstarted in the 1990's to help parents pay for college for their children
171,  The idea seemed simple -Illinois residents could purchase college tuition at current rates and that money would be investedand grow to cover the eventual costs of their children's college education
172,"  Over 70,000 Illinoisfamilies took advantage of this opportunity"
173," But 25 years later, the program was underfunded bynearly 30%, leaving parents holding the bag for a promise unfulfilled by state government"
174,  That'snot right
175,  So my budget proposes to pay off that unfunded state liability in full
176," Parents will sleepbetter at night, and it saves an additional $75 million dollars in future taxpayer liabilities"
177," Responsible fiscal management is yielding substantial savings, unburdening our state from theanchor that has weighed us down for far too long"
178," So, as we move on to tackle the questions of what vital current priorities our government shouldfund, know that we start from a place where our bills are paid, our most pressing short-term debtsare nearly gone and our most critical long term financial liabilities are in the best fiscal shape theyhave been in since the turn of the century"
179," The proposed 2023 budget I have submitted today includes substantial increases in the highestyielding investments we can make: early childhood, K-12 and higher education"
180," Notably, there is a$350 million increase for the K-12 Evidence Based Funding Formula, driving critical resources toour state's most underfunded schools"
181," I have also increased early childhood education by $54million, which together with the $200 million investment in upskilling our early childhood workforcewill go a long way toward meeting our goal of making Illinois the best state in the nation to raiseyoung children"
182," In years past, higher education had become an afterthought in our state budgets"
183," Because of thedisinvestment, post-secondary education became more and more expensive for students and theirfamilies"
184," That's why at the beginning of my term I pledged to do three things to address thisproblem: Increase MAP scholarships by $200 million, get more Pell Grants and low cost federalloans for Illinois students, and increase direct support for institutions of higher learning"
185," With thisFY23 budget proposal, we will have achieved all three during my first term in office, withsubstantial increases in MAP grants, community college and university operational support, and jobtraining investments"
186,"  The cost of pursuing higher education in Illinois is finally going down, andwe're opening the door to a brighter future for more Illinoisans"
187, I'm also asking the General Assembly to broaden the allowable uses of MAP scholarships for careertraining programs in critical industries like healthcare
188," This small change will open more trainingddiiifhdfIlliidiilllkddiand education opportunities for thousands of Illinoisans, and it will put people to work addressingthe critical healthcare workforce shortage"
189, Our healthcare institutions and healthcare workers need help
190, That's why this proposed budgetcreates the Pipeline for the Advancement of the Healthcare Workforce — or PATH — program
191, Thegoal is to model this program after the highly successful Workforce Equity Initiative championed byState Representative Jehan Gordon-Booth
192, The PATH program will invest $25 million in ourcommunity colleges to remove barriers for recruitment and training of new front-line healthcareworkers
193,  My budget also proposes to invest new resources in nursing scholarships and loanforgiveness programs
194,"   And finally, I'm proposing to eliminate licensure fees for 470,000 nurses, physicians, pharmacists,pharmacy technicians, respiratory care workers, social workers and others in the coming fiscalyear"
195, Let's recognize the burden our healthcare workers have borne and give them a much-neededreprieve
196, Aggressively protecting and supporting vulnerable children and families is a high priority for us all
197," Since coming into office, I've substantially increased the budget at the Department of Children andFamily Services to reverse the damage of the prior administration, bringing on hundreds of newstaff, retraining every DCFS worker and manager, allowing our private partners to increase wages,and helping them make a dent in the hundreds of shelter beds lost under the prior administration"
198,"This year, as the agency continues to battle pandemic-era worker shortages and increased case-load, I propose we add another $250 million to hire more child welfare workers, and increase thenumber of safe and supportive settings available to care for vulnerable children"
199," Nobody has escaped the isolation, burn out, and trauma of the past two years"
200," Now more thanever, it's important to invest in behavioral health"
201, That's why I will be appointing a Chief BehavioralHealth Officer to oversee and coordinate behavioral health services directly with the Governor'sOffice
202," Behavioral health is an area where Representative Deb Conroy is a real leader, and withpartners across the rotunda like Senators Sara Feigenholtz and Laura Fine, I'm confident the ChiefBehavioral Health Officer will succeed in streamlining and coordinating these services across stateagencies"
203, And we can't talk about health in this state without recognizing the tremendous leadership of Lt
204,Governor Stratton to expand Alzheimer's awareness and bring the world closer to eradicating thisheart-breaking disease
205," Over the summer, we made Illinois the first state in the nation to requireregular Alzheimer's diagnosis training for all licensed, adult-serving healthcare professionals"
206,"Building on that progress, today I'm proposing an expansion of Illinois' Alzheimer's outreach,research, care and support"
207," With the state and the nation experiencing a rise in violent crime, addressing public safety requiresmajor investments"
208, But too often those elected officials yelling the loudest about public safetyconcerns are also those voting to defund government budgets
209,"  Crime is a complex and multi-faceted problem to tackle, and it's cynical and counter-productive to simply shout ""Lock them up""hilidifhldhiihfilwhile providing fewer resources to the people and programs that prevent crime in the first place"
210, A truly effective approach to tackling crime involves both short term and long-term investmentsand a commitment to see those investments through
211,"  Let's start with this: If we want to reduce crime, we have to solve crimes"
212, That's why I reestablishedthe Division of Criminal Investigations when I first took office
213," It's why we are building a new, state-of-the-art crime lab near Joliet and opening another in Decatur"
214, My proposed budget continues toincrease the number of Illinois State Police forensic scientists and evidence technicians
215, And we'realready succeeding in one important arena — we've substantially reduced the backlog of DNA andother analyses on evidence in sexual assault cases
216," As a result, victims and survivors will finally getthe justice they deserve"
217," On the front lines, I've been growing our state police every year since I took office, but they needeven more support"
218," Under my predecessor their ranks had been severely depleted to only 1,625troopers, down 31% from its peak"
219, So every year I've worked with the majority in the GeneralAssembly to rebuild the ISP
220," On top of the hundreds of sworn officers we've hired already, the FY23budget provides resources to add largest number of state police cadets in any single year"
221, Victims and witnesses need to feel safe if they're going to be willing to come forward and identifyviolent criminals
222," Nearly a decade ago, Speaker Welch and Senator Van Pelt led the creation of theGang Crime Witness Protection Program"
223,  It was intended to provide resources to prosecutors andthe Attorney General to pay for the protection of victims and witnesses who are assisting in theprosecution of gang violence perpetrators
224," Disappointingly, the program was never funded"
225, TodayI'm proposing we immediately authorize a $20 million investment in it
226,"  If we want people to speakup without fear of intimidation, we need to give law enforcement the resources they need toprotect victims and witnesses that want to do the right thing"
227," To prevent violent crime and reduce the direct burden on police, Illinois is awarding grants toorganizations that implement data-driven, community-driven violence prevention efforts"
228,  Thisbudget proposal advances our $250 million multi-year investment in crime prevention in theReimagine Public Safety Act
229,"  From the time I became Governor until this current fiscal year, wemore than doubled the funding for violence interruption, diversion, and youth employmentprograms to $517 million"
230, I'm proposing we increase that appropriation to $832 million
231," And as anadditional relief for police departments, this budget provides greater funding for police bodycameras"
232," Smart investments in front line personnel, in protecting witnesses, in community renewal, in mentalhealth, in economic opportunities, and in solving crimes are the best ways to reduce violence onour streets"
233, The 2023 budget continues providing direct grants for thousands more small businessessupporting their recovery
234, We're extending the Rebuild Downtowns and Main Streets program torevitalize community business districts across Illinois
235," On top of that, I propose suspending licenseffh23000dbbiiddiillifidhdfees for more than 23,000 restaurants and bars, bringing some additional relief to an industry hardhit by the pandemic"
236," Along with this small business support, I am calling on the General Assembly to renew theEconomic Development for a Growing Economy, or EDGE, Tax Credit Program which is set to expirein June"
237, EDGE is one of our most effective tools to grow and attract jobs
238,"   Right now, everyone is feeling the crunch of rising prices for goods and services"
239,  The higher costof even basic necessities is making it harder to make ends meet
240," Whether it's supply chaininterruptions or increasing oil prices, inflation is squeezing Illinois families"
241, Government ought to domore to ease the pain and put more money back in the pockets of hardworking Illinoisans
242, Ourbudget success gives us the opportunity to do just that

244," First, let's freeze the gas tax for the coming fiscal year"
245,"  Back in 2019, working with the GeneralAssembly, we passed a historic bipartisan infrastructure improvement plan"
246,"  Since then, countlessroads and bridges across the state have been repaired and improved to the benefit of localcommunities and businesses, and the federal infrastructure bill passed last year in Congress hasprovided additional funding"
247,"  Because the Illinois Department of Transportation has been efficientlycompleting projects on time and on budget, it has collected enough infrastructure dollars alreadyto allow us to freeze the gas tax for a year without affecting any of our road projects"
248, It will bringimmediate relief at the gas pump and still allow us to upgrade our infrastructure
249, Another place where families are getting hit hard by rising costs is at the grocery store
250,"  Access toaffordable food is fundamental to the American promise, but with the price of milk and eggs andbread going up, pocketbooks are being pinched"
251,"  We can afford to suspend the state tax ongroceries in the coming year, and have the state make up any lost revenue to local governments, sowe can bring some relief to families at the check-out counter"
252," Finally, local property taxes have long been an unsustainable burden for homeowners acrossIllinois"
253," Local governments, who impose property taxes, have received an unprecedented influx ofcash from the federal government in the last year, and an additional $1"
254,1 billion in annual supportdue to actions taken by the state
255, It's time for every local taxing district to take a long hard look atreducing the burden of high property taxes they impose on their local residents
256,"  At the state level, we can also take action"
257, I propose immediate property tax relief funded by thestate surplus
258,"  If we double the property tax deduction for Illinois homeowners, we can bring reliefto nearly 2 million Illinois taxpayers"

262," With all the challenges we have overcome, with all the work it took to get here, with all the thingswe may face in the future - here's one thing I know for sure: Illinois is the best place to live in theentire country"
263," Our history is more interesting, our food more flavorful, our businesses more innovative, ourworkers more industrious, our schools more distinguished, our culture more illuminating and ourpeople more diverse and intelligent and creative than any other state in this great wide country ofours"
264," Contrary to those folks who spend their time orbiting Illinois politics just spelunking for misery, ourstate has a lot to be proud of"
265," We are modernizing our roads, our bridges, our schools and our broadband"
266," Thanks to RebuildIllinois, we've repaired over 3,300 miles of roads and 320 bridges in just the last two and a halfyears"
267, We now have the number one ranked infrastructure in the country
268," We have become a national leader in addressing climate change, even being recognized on theworld stage at the United Nations climate conference in Scotland last year, when Illinois becamethe first Midwest state to require 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2045"
269," We acted swiftly and boldly last fall to reap the potential financial benefits of the new energyeconomy by passing the REV Act, providing attractive incentives for electric car manufacturers toset up shop in Illinois and bring new jobs to our communities"
270,"  We have also made it less expensivefor consumers to buy and drive an electric vehicle by offering $4,000 rebates to consumers andincentivizing the buildout of charging stations statewide"
271," At a time when people need reliable healthcare more than they ever have before, we provided $3"
272,8billion to hospitals serving Medicaid patients to increase access in underserved communities
273,  Wemade Illinois among the first states in the nation to require that insurers cover substance useprograms and mental health treatment
274, We made pandemic-era telehealth access permanent
275, Wecapped out-of-pocket insulin costs
276,  And we made it harder for insurance companies todiscriminate against those seeking fertility treatments
277," And at a time when politicians in some places have dipped their toes into the waters of sedition, orpulled chairs up for the ghosts of Jim Crow, or spurned the fires of educational curiosity in favor ofbook banning, or are telling women you have to take your reproductive health choices back to the1950's"
278,
279,
280,at a time when some would question the very foundations of science and medicine
281,
282,
283,at atime when some would condemn simple acts of courtesy and kindness like wearing a mask so thatfewer people die
284,
285,
286, THIS government in THIS state said
287,
288,
289,Not Here
290," In Illinois, our elections are protected because we're not scared of more people voting"
291," In Illinois, we care about expanding the freedoms and opportunities for our Black and brownresidents"
292," In Illinois, we built a firewall around the freedoms of every woman in this state, protecting the rightto choose in our laws and prohibiting the Supreme Court from taking it away"
293," In Illinois, we believe all workers deserve a real living wage and the right to organize"
294," In Illinois, we are not afraid of our history"
295,
296,
297,"after all, this country's past, some of its lowest and itshighest moments, runs straight through this state Capitol"
298," Abraham Lincoln, who once stood onthis very spot under this dome, once said: ""We cannot escape history"
299," The fiery trial through whichwe pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation"
300,""" In Illinois, we believe that the best thing we can do in difficult times is look out for one another"
301,  Leadership in times like these does not dance idly wherever the wind might blow
302,  Leadership intimes like these means having the courage to stand on deck while the waves crash around you andyou keep the ship pointing toward home
303, The din of a crisis is when a carnival barker's shout becomes a whisper soft enough to find the earsof the sick or worried or grieving or scared
304,
305,
306,"and the poison they worm into the hearts of thevulnerable is that it's ""those people"" "
307,
308,
309,"the ones who live in that city, the ones who worship at thataltar, the ones who were born in that place"
310,
311,
312,who are responsible for the hard times
313,   It's a playbook as old as the play
314,  And it's that kind of thinking I am asking you to reject in thismoment
315, I KNOW how hard everything feels right now
316,  I know that for the last two years it seems like wehave all been reaching for the shadow of a former life
317," You've been asked to sacrifice more than is fair, and we are all worried our hearts have forgottenhow to find hope "
318,
319,
320,but I am here to tell you that they haven't
321, I know that — because Illinois reminds me every single day of her kindness and her hope
322,"  I see it intired smiles, in tidy laughs, in the faces of parents protecting their children and in childrenprotecting their parents"
323,"  I glimpse it in the eyes that peek out over masks nodding at me quietly, orpulling me aside to tell me about a food kitchen they're trying to help or a blood drive they're tryingto publicize or a family they're trying to lift up"
324, I told you when I was elected that I would be a relentless optimist for this wonderful place that wecall home
325,  I didn't tell you I would be an optimist only if times weren't hard
326,  I didn't tell you I wouldbiilifhhllbe an optimist only if the challenges were easy
327, I didn't tell you that there was a limit to the hope I could find for this state
328,  Because there's not
329, Illinois has never let me down
330,  Not once
331,  Not even in some of her darkest hours
332, Maybe the clarity that grief and struggle bring will allow us to cast off the old parts of our lives thatnever served us well to begin with
333,  Maybe the resilience we've found facing a once in a generationchallenge has opened a path to new and better things
334,   Maybe it's time we remember what Margaret Mead was trying to teach her class during that lecturelong ago: that who we are is measured by how we care for those who need us
335,  And that wewouldn't be standing here today if that simple ancient value wasn't deeply ingrained into our veryexistence
336, Illinois
337,
338,
339,the state of our great state is STRONG
340,
341,
342,unbreakable
343,
344,
345,and enduring
346,"  It is sustained everyday by the deep, overwhelming kindness of its people, by the hopes of its leaders and by ourcommon commitment to face an uncertain tomorrow with the strength built by surviving ouryesterdays"
