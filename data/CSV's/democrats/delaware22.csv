6, The word “coronavirus” meant nothing to most of us
7, We were looking forward to a bright year ahead
8,"   Our plans did not include a global pandemic, I can tell you"

25,"   1  As Prepared for Delivery   Over the last year, Director Schall, Dr"
26, Rattay and their teams helped deliver more than 1
27,6 million vaccines to Delawareans
28,  Our Lieutenant Governor was instrumental in those efforts
29," She rallied communities, worked vaccine sites, and went out into neighborhoods, making sure people in every corner of our state had access to the vaccines"
30,"   And community leaders stepped up big – people like Reverend Rita Paige, Bernice Edwards, Darryl Chambers and his team, and Maria Matos"
31,"   Because of the efforts of so many, we were one of only 20 states to meet President Biden’s goal – 70 percent of adults vaccinated by July 4"
32,   This work saved lives
33,   We provided more than $400 million in support to small businesses
34," We supported child care providers, who stayed on the job throughout this crisis"

38, They’re innovative
39, They’re kind

45,   And we are eager for what lies ahead
46,"  As we recover from this pandemic, it’s clear that expanding economic opportunity for all Delaware families must be job number one"
47,   We can all agree on this: a good job solves a lot of problems
48,  So let’s start there
49,"  On my first day in office in 2017, we partnered with the private sector to strengthen our economic development efforts"
50,"    2  As Prepared for Delivery   Working with all of you, we created the Delaware Prosperity Partnership"

56,4 percent in April 2020

62," Their new building in Wilmington, which is almost complete, will accommodate 500 employees"
63,   We’re building Delaware’s economy for the future

80,"   We’ll repair roads and bridges, invest even more in public transit, and build out electric vehicle infrastructure"
81, So important for the future
82,"  That will make commutes shorter, improve safety on our roads, and prepare Delaware for the future"
83,"   We’re also investing in our environment, and we have a new Climate Action Plan to address the effects of climate change"
84, Not just because it’s the right thing to do
85,    4  As Prepared for Delivery   But because we know that vibrant outdoor spaces help attract new workers and families
86, I especially want to thank Senator Hansen for her work to protect our natural environment
87,   Delaware State Parks continue to be among the best in the country
88,   And you don’t have to take my word for it
89,"  In November, our Parks again received the National Gold Medal for Excellence"
90,   Delaware is one of only two states to win this award twice
91,    Everyone should get out and enjoy our parks

102, That’s our slogan
103, I am determined to help clean up our highways and byways
104,   All these investments will strengthen our economy for the future
105,"   We know that nationally, and in Delaware, small businesses drive job creation"
106,"   That’s why, for the first time ever, we put a hyper focus on small business inside state government"
107,   That includes supporting innovative new tech companies and mom-and-pop mainstream businesses
108,"   Since 2019, our EDGE Grants program has supported more than 35 small businesses"
109, These businesses are creating jobs and poised for growth
110,"    5  As Prepared for Delivery   At the same time, we invested more than $400 million in pandemic relief dollars to shore up businesses hardest hit by the pandemic – like bars and restaurants, museums, child care centers, and hotels"
111,  Business owners tell me this helped them keep their doors open
112,   Supporting businesses also means supporting the employees who work there
113,   We know workers are not just looking for a job
114," They’re looking for a way of life, especially as they start a young family"
115,   They believe that good jobs should also support their families when they need that support the most
116,  And I agree
117,  Senator McBride has introduced legislation that would build on the work we’ve done for state employees and extend paid leave into the private sector
118,  It’s the right thing to do - and it will make Delaware more attractive for younger workers
119,  I’d like to thank Senator McBride and Representative Heffernan for their leadership on this important issue
120,"  With the leadership of Senator Walsh, we also set Delaware on course to a $15 minimum wage"
121,   We are taking the lead in state government
122," Two years ago, we made a commitment to make sure every state employee makes at least $15 an hour"
123,"   Next week, when I release my budget, we’ll talk more about how we’re supporting state employees on the lower end of the wage scale"
124,"   Going forward, building a workforce ready for jobs of the future may be our biggest challenge – here in Delaware and across the nation"
125,"   Delaware employers have more than 33,000 open positions right now"
126," But only 26,000 Delawareans are actively looking for work"
127,"   Across the country, there are 10"
128,"5 million open positions, but only 6"
129,8 million applicants
130,  That’s why we’re investing more than $50 million in federal stimulus funds to strengthen our workforce training programs
131,  6  As Prepared for Delivery    We’re also expanding Pathways programs in public middle schools and high schools
132,"  By next year, these public-private investments will expand the Pathways program to reach more than 6,000 middle school students and 80 percent of high school students"
133,"  That will help students like Imani Wulff-Cochrane, whom I met recently"
134, Imani is a senior at St
135, George’s Tech
136," She spends a third of her day in an early childhood center, learning on the job"
137,  Imani’s focus on work-based learning will prepare her to enter the workforce as soon as she graduates from high school

145,"    Thanks to Representative Williams and Senator Poore, we finally invested in K-3 basic special education"
146,  And it’s making a real difference in classrooms
147,"   One thing that the past two years have taught me is that there is value in acknowledging, and celebrating, the complexity of our state"
148, And our complex and often difficult history
149," That’s why I was proud to sign Representative Dorsey Walker’s bill into law, ensuring that a robust, accurate, Black history curriculum is taught in Delaware public schools"
150,   I was also fortunate to join Black clergy and community leaders in visiting the newly discovered African Burial Ground at the John Dickinson Plantation
151," And to partner with the Department of  7  As Prepared for Delivery   State, the Office of Statewide Equity Initiatives, the Delaware Heritage Commission, and Delaware State University to tell the public the real history of that site"
152,"  Over the past few months, I’ve been focused on making sure we finally deliver for the children of the City of Wilmington"
153,"   Despite the best efforts of teachers and administrators, children in our largest city are not getting the education they need to be successful in life"
154,  We can do better – and we must
155, These children and their families deserve our best efforts
156,"   Over the last month, I’ve knocked doors and talked directly to parents and students"
157,   I know they’re eager for change
158, They want better
159,"  I’ve talked to, and heard from, educators in our City schools"
160,  The idea of the Wilmington Learning Collaborative is based on models we’ve seen be successful in other parts of the country
161,"   We’re asking districts that serve our students in the city – Red Clay, Brandywine, and Christina – to work together on behalf of these children"
162,   This model will place more decision-making in the hands of educators and local communities
163," And it’ll offer more support for students, families, and importantly the teachers in the classroom"
164,  It will place a hyper focus on these students and the challenges they face
165,"  It doesn’t solve every problem, to be sure"
166,   We will continue to work with Senator Lockman and the Redding Consortium to focus on issues around redistricting and the high school challenge for city students
167, These are certainly important issues
168,   But we can’t let those issues hold us up
169,   We can’t afford to wait
170, And we can’t afford to keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result
171,   Please join me in finally doing right by these children
172,    8  As Prepared for Delivery   We know that a good education is not the only thing children and families need in order to be successful
173,   State Housing Director Eugene Young and his team have been working hard to address a housing crisis that has been made worse by the pandemic
174,"   Using federal funds, the State Housing Authority is partnering with the private sector to rebuild the Riverside community in northeast Wilmington"
175, It’s a very exciting project
176,  The Housing Authority has made available $50 million in rental and mortgage assistance to Delawareans struggling to get by across our state
177,"   And over the next three years, we will invest federal dollars to revitalize and develop more than 1,200 affordable housing units in Kent and Sussex counties"
178, That’s in addition to expanding down payment and settlement assistance for homebuyers
179,   These investments will go a long way to support Delawareans who need it most – and strengthen our economy at the same time
180,   It’s also way past time to make sure every home and business is connected to the internet
181,"    Currently, close to 11,600 Delaware homes and businesses lack access to high-speed broadband"
182,"   Delawareans rely on stable internet connections to apply for jobs, help their children do homework, work from home, or continue their education online"
183,   We’re investing over $100 million in federal money to make sure everyone has access to a hardwired connection
184, Mostly in Kent and Sussex counties
185,  We also continue to tackle the epidemic of substance abuse statewide
186, Our Lieutenant Governor’s leadership of the Behavioral Health Consortium is having a real impact
187,"   Despite the national rise in overdose rates during COVID, Delaware was one of only four states to see a decrease in the rate of overdose deaths"
188,   The Lieutenant Governor will continue to be a driving force to ensure access to treatment and prevention
189,"   I also want to take this opportunity to thank my wife, Tracey, for her support during this challenging time"
190, And for her relentless advocacy on behalf of children across our state
191,    9  As Prepared for Delivery   She always reminds me how much children have sacrificed through this pandemic to keep their families and communities safe
192,"   Through her First Chance Delaware initiative, Tracey has put a spotlight on issues facing children and has shown the value of working together"
193,   Through Trauma Matters Delaware – and in partnership with Casey Family Programs – Tracey is tackling the effects of trauma on Delaware children and families
194,"   Tracey has also partnered with the Food Bank of Delaware, which has stepped up time and again during this pandemic"
195," I’d like to thank the Food Bank, its workers, and volunteers for their incredible work"
196,   Probably our most popular statewide initiative this year has been Tracey’s work with the Dolly Parton Imagination Library
197, Everybody loves Dolly
198,   This program provides free books to children – enrolling newborns before they leave the hospital – and helps families build libraries that can last generations
199,   Please join me in thanking Tracey for her work
200,   Let me be clear about this point – and you won’t be surprised to hear it
201,"   We can’t make investments in public education – or infrastructure, or public safety - without a long-term, sustainable financial plan"
202,   Responsibly managing our state budget is more important than ever
203,   And it’s what every taxpayer I’ve ever talked to expects
204,"   Over the past five years, we have worked hard – and worked together – to get our state budget in order"
205," I’d like to thank members of the JFC – and your chairs, Senator Paradee and Representative Carson – for your work"
206,    We have built significant new reserves and directed one-time revenue into one-time infrastructure projects
207,"   We made it through the worst of the pandemic better than most states:   •  WITHOUT painful budget cuts,  •  WITHOUT tax increases,  •  and WITHOUT layoffs of state employees"
208,"   10  As Prepared for Delivery    Next week, I will present a budget that stays true to these principles"
209,   We will again invest in our classrooms with the expansion of Opportunity Funding
210,  We will use one-time revenue to continue the largest infrastructure program in Delaware history
211,   We have a unique opportunity to make real progress on these issues not just because of our work here in Delaware
212,  But also because of the passage of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure bill
213,"   With these investments, we’ll strengthen our economy, expand opportunity, and support families as we finally emerge from this pandemic"
214,   And we’ll do it responsibly
215,"   As most of you know, I’ve served in government now in some capacity for nearly three decades"
216,    I’ve never seen a more challenging time
217,"     As I think about the past two years, and how it fits into the long history of our great state, I can’t help but think about the recent passing of Governor Ruth Ann Minner"
218,     Governor Minner did not have an easy time leading up to being governor
219, Or during her two terms wrestling with your predecessors over a laundry list of sticky issues
220,"     One thing you could count on with Ruth Ann, though, was when she faced a political issue or policy choice, she always approached it through the lens of: how it will affect people’s everyday lives"
221,"     And another thing you could count on, was that when she made a tough call – and she had to make many – she would stand by it"
222,"      Please join me in a round of applause to pay tribute to this remarkable leader – the first woman governor of Delaware   Throughout this pandemic, I’ve had to make a lot of tough calls"
223,   I know we’ve not always agreed on every decision
224, And I respect those differences
225,    But I hope you know this
226, I have always put Delawareans first
227,"    11  As Prepared for Delivery     Since the early days of March 2020, when I wake up each morning and when I go to sleep each night, I’m thinking about the health of our people"
228, And about the businesses that employ them
229,     I know this has been a difficult time
230,     But Delawareans have proven their resilience
231,"   Every time they’ve been knocked down, they get back up"
232,"    As a result, unemployment is down"
233, Children are back in school
234, Small businesses survived
235, And we are supercharging our economy with federal resources
236,   So my message today is this: We will come through this crisis
237," And when we do, we’ll be ready as a state to move forward – together"
238,"   It is my sincere hope that when I stand before you next year, the pandemic will be firmly in the rearview mirror"
239," But the last two years have taught me that whatever happens, our state will rise to the occasion"
240,    Thank you very much
241,"   God Bless you, and God Bless our great State"
242,  12
