1," Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday delivered her fourth State ofthe State address, commencing the second session of the 55th Legislature"
2,The text of the governor’s 2022 State of the State address as prepared is as follows:Good afternoon
3, Thank you Mr
4," Lieutenant Governor, Mr"
5," Speaker, Madam SenatePro Tem, distinguished senators and representatives, and my fellow New Mexicans,and Happy Birthday to my Mom: I am humbled, once again, to have theopportunity to address the state of our great state"
6,"I know there is a temptation to view today as the opening kickoff of a big game, orthe launch of some great battle"
7, Some will describe it that way
8," But I encourage youto do what you can to resist the perception of a “competition,” to avoid feeding aplotline that would pit one team against another"
9, This isn’t the sports page
10, We’reall here to do the people’s business
11, It’s a sacred thing
12, And we’re all on the sameteam today – and in fact every day
13,At the outset of every legislative session I encourage my colleagues in this buildingto think about the people we are all here to serve
14," I think about their dreams, theirhopes and fears; and I think about what service means, about what effectiveservice can deliver for the workers and families all across New Mexico who arerepresented here in this building – the entrepreneurs and job-creators, the seniorsand students, the New Mexicans of every background and belief system"
15," No, wedon’t agree on everything, and we don’t have to"
16," But I believe that the values weshare as New Mexicans still truly unite us: The desire to see our families grow andthrive, the willingness to work hard to enjoy what we earn, the optimism thattomorrow can and will be better than today, for ourselves and for our neighbors"
17,"In the last three years, this Legislature and this administration have gotten a lotdone"
18, We raised the minimum wage for the ﬁrst time in a decade
19, We’veguaranteed paid sick leave to every worker in the state
20, We made early education akey priority and have invested hundreds of millions into the future of our earliestlearners
21," We invested in new economic sectors and we’ve sent thousands moreNew Mexicans of every age and background to college for free, no strings attached"
22,And I could go on
23, I could talk for a long time about the good work of the last fewyears
24,"But we need to talk, instead, about what people are really feeling"
25, The needs of thismoment remain great
26," The grief, the loss, the volatility brought on by this hideouspandemic has wreaked havoc on the lives of every family, every American, everyhuman being around the planet"
27," And add on top of that inﬂation, a supply chaincrisis, gridlock in Washington: It’s all making it harder for everybody, and especiallyregular working people, to feel safe, to feel comfortable, to feel optimistic"
28, And weall feel it
29," My family and I, my daughters, my ﬁancé, my grandkids – all of us, thereare no exceptions"
30," New Mexicans are calling out for safety and stability, for moreand more equal opportunity, for an open and fair and free democracy that worksand works for them"
31,"Over these next 30 days, we can and we will answer that call, together"
32,"Once again, this incredible state, our home, is on the precipice of momentouspositive change"
33, I said that three years ago when I ﬁrst swore an oath to carry outthe duties of this ofﬁce to the best of my ability
34, It’s been true every day since then
35,"If anything the opportunity has grown, has multiplied exponentially; the sun isrising on a pivotal day, and I believe everything and anything is possible"
36,"We have, right now, unimaginable ﬁnancial resources at our disposal"
37," I believe wecan fulﬁll, once and for all, after a hundred-and-ten years of statehood, the destinyof New Mexico as a genuine homestead of the American Dream, a place wherepeople can grow and thrive and live in peace and prosperity, where people havethe resources they need to support themselves and their families"
38," What we do herenow, what we do in the coming weeks, will set the stage"
39,"Dating back decades, a timid mindset has afﬂicted people in this capitol building, apessimism that can be self-fulﬁlling"
40, Thinking small is a curse
41," Big and meaningfulchanges are possible, but the biggest change may be our attitude, our perspective"
42,"At a moment in time when we have the money to do it all, let’s not limit ourselves;let’s not be unnecessarily incremental"
43," Can’t New Mexico be a state – can’t we bethe state – where everything is possible?So, on that note, let’s give every single educator in this state a 7% raise this year,minimum"
44," That would be the biggest pay bump in recent memory, and it wouldput us ﬁrst in the region for average educator pay"
45," They deserve it, and we canafford it, and it’s the right thing to do"
46," Let’s also raise the starting salaries for everytier of educators, which means some teachers will see a 20% raise this year"
47, And letme be clear: This kind of progress pays for itself
48," When we support educators, whenwe retain high-quality teachers and keep our schools brimming with talentedprofessionals, our other strategic investments in New Mexico children and in publiceducation are supported and sustained"
49, Our graduation rates will continue to rise
50,"Our literacy rates will continue to improve, especially with a targeted new phonicsprogram that we have initiated and that the Legislature must continue to support"
51,We get more kids into high-quality apprenticeship programs and institutions ofhigher learning that will help them build fulﬁlling careers and lives
52," It all starts withdemonstrating support and respect for our educators; Day One, I said we would dothat, and we’re getting it done"
53,And we’re going to keep going: Let’s cut taxes for every single person in NewMexico
54, We haven’t cut the sales tax in this state in 40 years
55," It’s only gone up andup and up, for decades, burdening New Mexico households and making it harderfor our small businesses to be competitive"
56," But under my tax cut proposal, NewMexicans would save more than 170 million dollars every year"
57," As my colleaguesfrom across the aisle have pointed out in years past, correctly, that money doesn’tbelong in government accounts; it belongs in the pockets of hard-working NewMexicans"
58," I agree, and I expect the Legislature to prioritize this relief"
59,I feel the same way about the taxes that are taken out of social security beneﬁts
60,New Mexico is one of only a few states that taxes social security
61, I am calling todayfor that taxation to end
62, We must unburden the New Mexicans who rely on socialsecurity beneﬁts by cutting their taxes
63," This is good government, serving thepeople who have asked us to serve them"
64, New Mexicans deserve it
65," Because Ibelieve we have an obligation to ﬁnd ways to make life easier for the people of NewMexico, and I will keep looking for ways to do exactly that"
66,And there are more tax cuts on the horizon
67, Our expansion of the Working FamiliesTax Credit last year has already saved hundreds of dollars each for about a quarterof a million New Mexicans – the New Mexicans who need those savings the most
68,"Every dollar counts when we’re trying to support the middle class, when we’retrying to help workers build careers and help families build stability"
69," Next year, ahalf a million more New Mexico taxpayers will beneﬁt from these expanded credits"
70,This has been the most signiﬁcant and progressive reform of our tax code in ageneration; this is real and meaningful change that helps families keep the lightson and keep food on the table
71," This is money that is going right back into thepocket of the single mom, the small business owner, the veteran who served ourcountry and our state"
72," Day One, I said we were gonna make this economy work forthe everyday New Mexican, and we’re getting it done"
73, So let’s keep going
74, In thenext 12 months your state government is going to deliver an additional $230 millionin rent and utility assistance to the New Mexicans who need it most
75, Your stategovernment will continue to help keep the heat on in hundreds of thousands ofhouseholds across our state
76, We will not leave families behind
77," And if theLegislature provides the resources, your state government will do more than justhelp families stay aﬂoat; we can and we will genuinely invest in New Mexicofamilies and lift them up"
78, Because families don’t need to be worrying about asurprise medical bill or car repairs; they don’t need to worry about hunger either
79," Inthe ﬁrst two years of this administration, New Mexico reduced food insecurity at thesecond-best rate of any state in the country"
80, We all know there’s more to do
81, Butthat’s the kind of progress you can build on
82, It should inspire us to keep going
83,"Reducing poverty and shielding more families from its effects is the mostimportant work any government, any worker anywhere, can do"
84,"In the last year, we’re 11th best for job growth in the country overall"
85," In three years,we have created over ten thousand jobs in every corner of our state; and those jobsnow have an average salary better than $90,000 a year: That’s a record high, and it’sa big bright signal to other businesses, like the hundreds of businesses that haverelocated here in the last three years, showing them how successful our public-private partnerships can be, and how business-friendly New Mexico is"
86," We’recutting red tape, and it is making a real difference for New Mexico business owners;I’m thinking of folks like Maurice Lemus in Raton, who was seeing businessevaporate into Colorado before we made changes; he was the ﬁrst New Mexican toreceive a new liquor license under the long-overdue reform we enacted"
87," That kindof aggressive go-get-it attitude, supported by a proactive state government thatwants to actively support businesses, will not only keep more patrons in Maurice’srestaurant but help entrepreneurs throughout our state"
88, People see the economicpotential of New Mexico now; we’re creating a real pipeline of jobs and opportunity
89,We are the frontier of economic growth
90," Unlike in the aftermath of the GreatRecession, we’re not gonna let the pandemic stall us and take away years ofgrowth; we will not have another lost decade – in fact, despite the challenges of thelast two years, we’ve hardly lost a step"
91, The fact is: Unemployment has gone downevery month for 10 straight months
92, The number of unemployed New Mexicansdropped by 5 percent in November alone
93, We’re expanding our economic footprintinto every single community
94, Legal cannabis is going to create thousands of jobsand serious tax revenue for local governments to support local services in everycorner of our state
95," Almost forty thousand more students receiving high-qualitycollege education for free under my Opportunity Scholarship program means moreskilled workers building 21st-century careers right here in Roswell, Espanola,Sunland Park, Rio Rancho, Chama and so many more; the intellectual infrastructureof a nationally competitive state economy is being built right here, right now, oncampuses and in communities through our state"
96," And clean hydrogen will supportthousands of jobs, especially in rural New Mexico, while helping us sprint towardour net-zero carbon deadlines and decarbonize the transportation sector"
97,"But if we want to keep up our economic momentum, and we have to, we have gotto get crime under control"
98, I don’t accept the argument that this is an issue in onlyone part of our state
99, I don’t accept that any decision-maker in this building wouldsay that somehow this isn’t their problem
100, We all have a role to play in keeping NewMexico safe
101," Public safety doesn’t just exist on its own; we have to create it, andsupport it, and own it"
102," So we need tougher penalties for the worst of the worst, therepeat offenders and those who have proven themselves to be a danger to ourcommunities; I support rehabilitation and this administration has done a lot ofinnovative good work in that area, but at the end of the day I stand with thefamilies and communities who have been victimized unnecessarily by the violentcriminals that this system needs to secure"
103," The worst offenders, the most seriousand dangerous criminals in our state, need to be behind bars, simple as that"
104," Andwe are going to pass a law, this session, that will keep violent criminals behind barsuntil justice can be done"
105, We will put a wedge in the revolving door of violent crimein New Mexico
106, The safety of our communities cannot be up for debate
107, A smart-on-crime approach can work; it has worked
108," In my ﬁrst year in ofﬁce, violent crimewent down for the ﬁrst time in 6 years: We can regain that momentum when wemake sure our local communities (and public safety ofﬁcers) have the resourcesand support they need"
109,"So I am asking the Legislature for a 19% increase in the budget of the departmentof public safety to fund innovative new crime ﬁghting strategies and hundreds ofnew positions, including a 19% raise for our state police ofﬁcers"
110, And I am asking for100 million to support hiring and retention efforts to get a thousand more ofﬁcersin place statewide as quickly as we can
111, I am asking for those things because NewMexicans are asking for them
112, New Mexico is a state that respects and supports lawenforcement ofﬁcers
113, I reject the rhetoric from Washington and elsewhere that hasmade public safety a political battleground
114," This isn’t about politics; it’s about basichuman respect for one another: Respect from ofﬁcers to the people they serve, andrespect for ofﬁcers from the communities they protect"
115," If we have that, we canmove forward, uniﬁed, in our desire to clean up the streets of this state, to keepviolent criminals behind bars, and to ensure every day that justice is done, equally,under the law"
116,We all want safe communities
117, And we all want healthy communities
118," Thisadministration has made important strides: We have capped costs for life-savingmedications, we’ve protected safeguards for those with pre-existing conditions,we’ve invested in affordable care for thousands of lower-income families, we haveeliminated co-pays for behavioral health services and we’ve begun the great task ofrebuilding a mental health care infrastructure that was decimated"
119," But, still, toomany people, especially people in the rural areas of our state, don’t have timelyaccess to the health care they need – or access at all"
120, Every community deserveshigh-quality care
121, I propose a new Rural Health Care Delivery Fund that will providebridge ﬁnancing to communities that have been waiting for assistance to kickstartconstruction without massive upfront costs; state government can help ﬁll thesegaps
122," With interventions like these, communities like those in Valencia County aremoving toward securing a brand new hospital, after years of delays"
123," And withinvestments like those I have proposed in my executive budget, we will put tens ofmillions of dollars into new behavioral health services, expanding access totreatment for substance abuse, suicide interventions and more"
124," New Mexicans callme about this issue more than almost any other, and we will answer that call"
125,We can and must ensure that kind of service-delivery is available throughout thestate – we have the resources to do so
126," That means endowing our medical schoolwith 10 million dollars, ensuring that we keep our best and brightest here toprovide care for New Mexicans after they graduate"
127," That also means endowing ournursing school with the power of the state, ensuring more highly skilledprofessionals enter this all-important ﬁeld"
128," And it means, once and for all, deliveringthe health care families in the rural parts of our state still desperately need"
129," When Ivisited Clayton last year I met Eloise Valdez, 92 years young, whose family cares forher 24/7"
130, It’s not easy
131," Thousands of New Mexicans are living the same story, unableto pay for outside help, because it’s too expensive, and it’s not covered"
132," As acaregiver myself, I know the strength and resilience it takes; I know it can bephysically and mentally exhausting"
133," Well, I think it’s time we start saying thank you,and I propose a dramatic expansion of the state program that directly supportscaregivers; what that means is we are going to pay families who are doing the workof taking care of their elderly loved ones, regardless of Medicaid eligibility"
134," Let’s callit New Mexi-Care, and let’s make it a model program for the rest of the country"
135," Thisis an investment in people that goes well beyond politics or any one politician; thisis the kind of investment that can be and should be a lasting service, one thatreﬂects our shared values as a state"
136," In this state, we provide for and care for ourparents, our grandparents, our disabled loved ones"
137," This state government, undermy leadership, will help provide for that care, unequivocally"
138," Caregiving is a full-time job, I know it ﬁrst-hand; and we respect working people in New Mexico"
139," Let’sinvest in the dignity of our elders, and of their families, by helping caregivers andthose they care for stay in their homes with the ﬁnancial support they need"
140,"On the same note, it is time that we build a new veterans home – a state-of-the-artindependent assisted-living facility for those who sacriﬁced to protect ourfreedoms"
141, The original building on the campus in T or C was built in 1936
142, I think it’stime for an upgrade
143," So I am calling for 60 million dollars, which we will leveragewith an additional $60 million from the federal government, to build the kind ofmodern facility our veterans, and their families, deserve"
144, We’re going to get it done
145,"Because when government has the right tools, and the right people, problems aresolved"
146," Yeah, we can dream big and make bold plans – it doesn’t matter much ifwe’re not solving people’s problems, each day"
147, And we are
148," Just a few months ago,Veterans Service Ofﬁcer Dagmar Youngberg in Carlsbad took a call from a veteranwho needed some help taking a fresh look at an old beneﬁts claim, a claim thathad been denied for decades"
149, This state employee at the Department of VeteransServices did some digging and got to work talking with the feds about what wentwrong
150," Turns out, a lot went wrong"
151," In the end, Ms"
152," Youngberg helped this disabledveteran get full back pay dating back 20 years, recovering 738,000 dollars in totalthat was owed to this individual, a person who served their state and their country"
153,She helped this veteran get off food stamps and pay off their mom’s mortgage
154, Thisis a government that is solving problems
155," And here’s why: Because it’s ﬁlled withNew Mexicans, and New Mexicans look out for their neighbors; we make the extraeffort to do what’s right; we get up when we’ve been knocked down and we ﬁghtfor what’s ours"
156,  The state of our state is ready to move forward
157, Ready to rise
158, We have all the toolswe need
159," My vision is this: Communities all across our state where families aren’tworried about the next bill, or their kids’ future, or a job market or health caresystem that doesn’t quite seem to work for them"
160," My vision is a New Mexico wherethe founding ideals of this great country – equal opportunity and justice for all – aremade real, and meaningful; where the pursuit of happiness is more than a phrasefrom a dusty piece of paper; it’s something tangible, something everyone canactually feel"
161,We can do it all
162, We have the ﬁnances
163, We’re going to fund an unprecedented suiteof new affordable housing programs at the state level
164, We’re going to expandprotections for voters because we believe in democracy and everyone’s right tovote
165," I subscribe to an optimism that says: Big things are within our reach, and blueskies are ahead – and hopefully some snow, too"
166,"When my grandfather was a young man he traveled across this state, across mesasand over mountains, in a covered wagon"
167," He never could have imagined that bythe time he was an old man he would see the Sandias from 30,000 feet in anairplane"
168, He never could have imagined his granddaughter would watch a rocketblast off and literally reach space from New Mexico
169, None of us can predict thefuture
170," It feels unsettled, especially these days"
171," But what I know, for a certainty, isthat we have the power to make that kind of a bold leap into the unknown beyond,together; we have the power to envision a bright tomorrow, and to execute thatvision, on behalf of the people"
172, And we must recommit ourselves to that unifyingpurpose today
173,"So for the next 30 days, let’s be aggressive on behalf of the New Mexicans we’re allhere to serve"
174, Let’s remember who beneﬁts from good public service
175," It’s not aboutpolitics, it’s about community: Your community; our community; the families andworkers and seniors and parents who just want to live in peace, and with dignity,conﬁdent in the promise of tomorrow and the stability of today"
176, We’ve made somuch progress
177, Let’s make sure New Mexicans feel it
178, Let’s go above and beyondand embrace the potential of this pivotal moment in time
