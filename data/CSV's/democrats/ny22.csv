1," In the address, Governor Hochul outlined nine key components ofher agenda: rebuilding our healthcare economy, protecting public safety and taking strong actionagainst gun violence, investing in New York’s people, investing in New York’s communities,making New York’s housing system more aﬀordable, equitable, and stable, making New York anational leader in climate action and green jobs, rebuilding New York’s teacher workforce andreimagining higher education, advancing New York’s place as a national equity model, andmaking critical reforms to restore New Yorkers’ faith in their government"
2,"The Governor's remarks as prepared are available below:Thank you, Lieutenant Governor"
3, You have been doing an outstanding job in such a short timeand I’m proud to have you by my side as we deliver for the people of New York
4,I also want to thank my partners in government
5," State Comptroller Tom DiNapoli, ()State AttorneyGeneral Tish James, Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Majority LeaderCrystal Peoples-Stokes, and I hope Speaker of the Assembly Carl Heastie gets well soon"
6,"And thank you to Pastor Soloman Dees and to Allie Navarette, for representing the Girl Scouts sowell"
7,"As I stand before you, I am well aware of the signiﬁcance of this moment: the ﬁrst time in NewYork’s history that a woman has delivered this annual address"
8, But I didn’t come here to makehistory
9, I came to make a diﬀerence
10,"To be sure, I have a deep reverence for our State’s remarkable past"
11," And we’re honoring it bycoming together in this beautiful Assembly Chamber, its original, and rightful, setting with electedleaders, joined together to serve the public"
12,"I’m fond of quoting a former member of this body, and one-time Governor, Teddy Roosevelt, whosaid: “It’s not the critic who counts… The credit belongs to the man – or, shall we say, the woman– who is actually in the arena"
13,"”To my colleagues and partners in government, for too long, Albany’s Executive and Legislativebranches were ﬁghting each other in that arena"
14, No more
15, That ends now
16,What I am proposing is a whole New Era for New York
17, The days of Governors disregarding therightful role of this legislature are over
18, The days of the Governor of New York and Mayor of NewYork City wasting time on petty rivalries are over
19, The days of New Yorkers questioning whethertheir government is actually working for them are over
20,And the days of three men in a room are clearly over – just ask the Majority Leader
21,We know that women are always held to a higher standard
22, So I know that I must not just meetbut exceed expectations for this to no longer be an historic achievement… but rather the norm
23,So we will do things diﬀerently
24,   From now on: we will share success
25, We will ﬁnd commonground
26," We will restore trust in this government, because it has been eroded for far too long"
27,And we will ﬁght like hell – not for turf…not for credit – but for New Yorkers
28,"I’ve been proud to stand with the members of this legislature, signing more than 400 of your billsinto law since September"
29, And we’re just getting started
30,  New Yorkers need the help of everyone in this room to pass an ambitious agenda
31," One thatresponds to the Covid-19 pandemic but also rebuilds our healthcare and teacher workforces,provides tax relief to those who need it most, speeds up economic growth and creates goodpaying, middle-class jobs, strengthens our infrastructure and confronts climate change, securespublic safety, makes housing more aﬀordable, ensures every New Yorker has a roof over theirheads and enacts bold reforms for our State government"
32,My fellow New Yorkers: This agenda is for you
33,Every single initiative is ﬁltered through the lens of how it will help you and your families
34," I knowyou’re exhausted, I know you want this pandemic to be over, I know you’re worried about theeconomy, inﬂation, your kids and their education and what the future holds"
35,We’ve endured so much hardship over these past two years
36," We’ve buried loved ones,experienced seismic shifts in our daily lives and missed out on so many of life’s preciousmilestones – holidays, weddings, graduations,the birth of a grandchild"
37,"There has been so much loss – of too many lives, and of too many of our hopes and dreams"
38,"And now, just when we thought we were turning a corner, there’s a new variant"
39, Another surge incases
40, It feels like déjà vu
41,And I know you’re all asking: Will we ever get through this? Yes
42, We will
43,   We’re New Yorkers
44, We’ve been knocked down before
45, We’ve been counted out
46," And inresponse, we never fail to defy the odds and rise to new heights"
47,New York always rises from the ashes
48, That is why I believe that this is not a moment ofdespair…
49,but a moment of great possibility
50," Because while we are in the midst of an all-consuming crisis we must also remember that if we make the right choices, right now it will end"
51,"But ﬁrst, we must weather the storm around us"
52, That means controlling this virus and not letting itcontrol us
53," When I took oﬃce, we immediately enacted a comprehensive pandemic plan and we’vecontinued to adapt as new variants like Omicron have emerged"
54," We’re doing everything we canto keep New Yorkers healthy: setting policies that have made our vaccination rate one of thehighest in the country, activating a military-style operation with vax and test sites, deploying theNational Guard to our hospitals and nursing homes and sending out 37 million tests across thestate"
55,"During this winter surge, our laser focus is on keeping our kids in school, businesses open andNew Yorkers’ lives as normal as possible"
56,"We are attacking this virus head-on, armed with a tactical, science-based approach and we areready for whatever comes next"
57,"But as we all know too well, this is more than a public health crisis"
58," We now need to support thepeople, places and industries hit hardest starting with the New Yorkers who have been on thefrontlines since day one"
59,"During those terrifying early months, while many hunkered down at home our healthcareworkers and ﬁrst responders showed up, day after day, night after night, double shift after doubleshift, putting their lives on the line to save others"
60,They’re not only physically exhausted – they’re emotionally exhausted too
61," I’ve seen it in theireyes, in hospitals from Buﬀalo to Potsdam just last week"
62,"That exhaustion combined with pre-existing staﬃng shortages, has resulted in a crisis"
63, We simplydo not have enough healthcare workers in our hospitals or in our long-term care facilities in ourambulances or in the homes of our loved ones
64,"The health of every New Yorker depends on a strong, stable, and equitable healthcare systemand healthcare workers are its very foundation"
65, Bold action is required – before any more timepasses
66,"First, we must stop the current hemorrhaging of healthcare workers and we’re going to do it notjust by SAYING we owe them a debt of gratitude but actually PAYING them the debt we owe,starting with a retention bonus of up to $3,000 to our health and direct care workers and we willdrive higher salaries throughout the healthcare workforce, so those doing God’s work here onearth are no longer doing it for minimum wage"
67,"Beyond salary, we will make it easier for doctors and nurses from other States to practice withtheir existing licenses here in New York"
68," We’ll expand the capacity of our medical institutions somore students can train for high-demand healthcare jobs, and we’ll make it possible for them toget that training with free tuition and stipends if they remain here after they graduate"
69,  A once-in-a-lifetime pandemic demands a once-in-a-lifetime response:That’s why I’m setting an ambitious goal to grow our healthcare workforce by 20% over the nextﬁve years
70," And we will make the largest investment in healthcare in State history, $10 billiondollars"
71," As we bolster our bone-tired healthcare workforce, we know they aren’t the only heroesof the pandemic"
72,"I am so grateful to the county leaders, school superintendents, administrators, parents andteachers for working so closely with us … to get kids back to school this week"
73,"The role of a teacher is irreplaceable in a child’s life and as the past two years have hammeredhome, they’re irreplaceable in a parent’s life, too"
74,"As a mother, I know this ﬁrst hand"
75, This workforce is also stressed and overworked
76," So we willramp up eﬀorts to recruit and retain teachers – with more eﬀective training and support, fasterand easier certiﬁcation, and stronger career pipelines and ladders"
77,And we will add more mental health professionals in schools to heal the wounds inﬂicted duringthe isolation of remote learning
78, Others are hurting as well
79," Families, small business owners,farmers – they all need our help"
80, They need it now and they’re going to get it
81,We will accelerate a $1
82,"2 billion-dollar tax cut originally scheduled to take eﬀect between nowand 2025, so that it all occurs earlier"
83, That means more than 6 million middle-class taxpayers getmore money in their pockets sooner at a time when inﬂation is robbing them of any gains inincome
84,"To help with property taxes, we will provide a $1 billion middle-class property tax rebate to morethan 2 million homeowners"
85," And to help parents get back to work, we’re going to expand accessto aﬀordable childcare to 100,000 more working families and invest $75 million in childcareworker wages"
86,"We will also deliver $100 million in much-needed relief to nearly 200,000 small businesses, tokeep their doors open and weather what the next few months bring"
87," These businesses are theeconomic engines of small towns and big cities alike, they’re what make our communities uniqueand give them personality"
88,"I should know, I’ve shopped and eaten in diners in most of them"
89,"I also helped my mother open a ﬂower shop and my sister start a small tech company, so I knowﬁrsthand how hard it is"
90," I know the risks taken by owners and entrepreneurs, and the barriersfaced by women"
91, So many small businesses were pushed to the brink
92, Thousands of bars andrestaurants – the souls of our neighborhoods – have had to close
93,"For others, hanging on by a thread, survival depends on whether they can create more spaceoutdoors, a tough task during our New York winters"
94," To help oﬀset these costs, we will provide atax credit for COVID-related purchases, like outdoor heaters and seating"
95, And we’re also goingto do something bars and restaurants have been asking for…
96,to once again allow the sale of to-go drinks – a critical revenue stream during the lean times last year
97,"Cheers, New York"
98,The farmers who supply restaurant kitchens – and our own – need a lifeline as well
99,"  I’ve visitedfarms from Genesee County to the North Fork of Long Island, and life is tough, even in goodyears"
100," So we’re going to support them through a tax credit for the overtime hours they arepaying, an increase in the Investment Tax Credit and an extension and doubling of the FarmWorkforce Retention Credit"
101,This will also begin to address the workforce shortage so many farms struggle with
102,"This is how we will begin to help healthcare workers, educators, small businesses, farms andfamilies deal with the devastating economic impacts of COVID"
103,"But beyond the pandemic, my agenda reﬂects my belief that we cannot allow the virus to grip usso tightly that it constrains us from looking to the future"
104, Longing for a simple return to our pre-pandemic world and way of life would not only be timid and unimaginative
105," It would ignore ourhistory and go against everything that makes New York, New York"
106,"If we can’t embrace the possibilities that come out of times like these, then we fail to honor thelegacy of the daring, visionary New Yorkers who came before us"
107,The portrait of Franklin Roosevelt that hangs above the mantle in the Governor’s residence is mydaily reminder of what leadership during a crisis is all about
108," First as Governor, and then asPresident, FDR literally rebuilt the economy from the ground up after the crash of ‘29"
109," More thangiving people jobs, he gave people hope"
110," The policies of his New Deal didn’t just help families who lost everything, they spurred decadesof economic growth and the birth of the middle class"
111," Again and again, he focused on the stormswirling around him, but kept one eye on the horizon, always planning for the day when theclouds would part"
112,That is exactly what we are doing now
113, This pandemic did not create all the problems we’refacing today
114, It simply forced us to hold up a mirror and see the cracks in our society that hadbeen too easy to ignore before
115, This crisis has created an opportunity to redeﬁne ourselves –and we must embrace it
116,"But as we embark on this New Era for our State, we need to take a hard look in that mirror anddeal with harsh realities"
117," Like the fact that 300,000 New Yorkers left our State last year"
118," That’s thesteepest population drop of ANY State in the nation, an alarm bell that cannot be ignored"
119," Tothose who left temporarily because of the pandemic or are trying to decide their next stepsduring these uncertain times, I have one message: you do not want to miss what’s going tohappen next"
120,"Right now, in real time, we are building a new New York worthy of your talents and ambitions"
121,We’re going to jumpstart our economic recovery by being the most business-friendly and worker-friendly State in the nation
122,"To entice people and businesses, we’re investing millions of dollars to transform the downtownsof our cities into magnets for new jobs and new opportunities and position both legacy andemerging industries for success"
123,New York is already home to some of the most consequential industries in the world
124," Finance,retail, healthcare, technology, fashion, entertainment, just to name a few"
125,But there is plenty of room for growth
126," More shovel-ready sites for new manufacturers andwarehouses, improvements in our freight infrastructure and investments in the technology thatwill power the jobs of the future"
127, And we’re going to make sure we have a workforce trained tostep into these jobs
128,"That’s why we will invest smartly and strategically in workforce development programs whichsimply means matching people to training, to jobs"
129,I know the demand is strong
130," At every one of the thousands of workplaces I’ve visited, theuniversal complaint is not having enough trained workers"
131," Every single place, it’s the same"
132,"That’s why we will reboot our Workforce Development Oﬃce, house it in Empire StateDevelopment so we can build stronger partnerships with employers and move funding throughour Regional Economic Development Councils so we grow programs that train for jobs that areactually in demand in diﬀerent parts of the State"
133," And the smart way to do it is to have school districts, community colleges, SUNY and CUNY allfocused on the same objectives"
134,"We are going to incentivize success, by tying a portion of workforce funding to high jobplacement rates"
135,"  We’re also going to make it easier to qualify as an MWBE, so everyone canhave access to opportunities"
136," It’s a commonsense approach, backed by an uncommon level offunding"
137, And it’s going to help supercharge our economy
138,Our goal is for New York to be known nationally as the place that grows and attracts the talent –and the businesses will follow
139," And for businesses to succeed, they need a well-trained andeducated workforce"
140,I believe to my very core that there is nothing more valuable than education and training when itcomes to unlocking opportunity and prosperity
141," It changes lives, across generations"
142,I know what education did for my own family’s circumstances
143," My grandparents ﬂed Ireland asteenagers because they had nothing – they were poor, with no hint of opportunity in their homecountry"
144," My grandfather ﬁrst became a migrant farm worker in the ﬁelds of South Dakota, thenlater he and Grandma were domestic workers and then, it all changed when he heard there weregreat jobs in a place called Buﬀalo, New York at the Bethlehem steel plant"
145,"Grandma found a job at Bell Aerospace, making parts for our planes during World War II"
146,  Thatwas their ticket to the life that they came in search of
147," But what really transformed my family was the fact that my father was able to get a collegedegree – at night, while working by day at the same steel plant as his father"
148,"If he hadn’t taken that leap, and invested in his own education, I would be living a very diﬀerentlife today"
149, My whole family would be
150," That’s why I am so focused on expanding educationalopportunities, starting by making the State’s tuition assistance program available to part-timestudents"
151, I believe that SUNY and CUNY are engines of social mobility and still have untapped potentialthat needs to be harnessed and unleashed
152,"So today, I am outlining a vision to make SUNY the BEST statewide public higher educationsystem in the nation"
153," How? Recruiting world-class faculty, creating ﬂagship institutions at StonyBrook and the University at Buﬀalo, investing more in our premier research facilities atBinghamton and Albany, leaning into the strengths of our four-year comprehensive colleges, ourtechnology colleges, and our community colleges, providing childcare on each campus,Increasing enrollment to 500,000 students by 2030, making SUNY a national leader on equity,increasing the number and diversity of people in every community with degrees and credentialsthat launch middle class careers and ensuring that SUNY campuses spur economic growth intheir surrounding communities"
154,"As we upgrade our Statewide higher education institutions, we also acknowledge that there arepopulations at-risk of falling through the cracks unless we target job training and educationopportunities to them as well"
155,"For example, we know that incarcerated people who participate in correctional educationprograms are far less likely to reoﬀend and 13 times more likely to obtain employment afterreturning home"
156,That outcome beneﬁts the formerly incarcerated…employers in need of workers…
157,the taxpayersof New York State – and it’s the right thing to do
158,"So today I’m announcing a new “Jails-to-Jobs,” initiative, so incarcerated people with have thesupport they need to ﬁnd employment during re-entry"
159, We’re also going to restore the TuitionAssistance Program for incarcerated people—ending a 30-year ban
160," As we create economic opportunity in every sector, there’s one industry that will be workingaround the clock for years to come, my friends in the construction trades, building infrastructurethe likes of which we’ve never seen"
161,Infrastructure can mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people
162," To me, it’s exciting because it’s allabout creating connections"
163,"  Connecting neighborhoods, connecting people to jobs andconnecting people to their families"
164,"Substandard infrastructure can mean long commutes, lost time from family, even missing a child’sbedtime"
165, Time in a tire repair shop after hitting a pothole adds more stress than anyone needs
166,That’s why I view building and improving our infrastructure as a quality of life issue
167,"In November, I stood with my former colleagues in Congress on the White House lawn whenPresident Biden signed the historic infrastructure bill, giving us a once-in-a-century chance toinvest"
168," We cannot let this moment slip by, and we won’t"
169,New Yorkers demand the best and that’s exactly what they’re going to get
170, Just look at what myadministration has already announced over the past four months
171,"We will ﬁnally transform Penn Station into world-class facility worthy of our City, ensure that theGateway Project ﬁnally moves forward, deliver long overdue upgrades to both LaGuardia andJFK Airports, and ﬁnish the 2nd Avenue Subway to connect East Harlem to jobs"
172,But we’re just getting started
173,"  Today, I’m announcing a bold idea—— take an old, unused, 14-mile-long right-of-way and createwhat we’re calling the Inter-Borough Express, new rail service that will connect Brooklyn andQueens"
174,"I am directing the MTA to immediately commence an environmental review, so we can get thisproject rolling down the track and I’m also directing the Port Authority to get moving on theCross-Harbor freight tunnel"
175,"As I said, infrastructure is about connections"
176," We need to reconnect neighborhoods that weresevered by asphalt highways, disproportionately impacting communities of color"
177,"We’re going to reverse the damage done more than half a century ago, with projects like theKensington Expressway in Buﬀalo, I-81 in Syracuse, the Inner Loop in Rochester, and the Cross-Bronx Expressway"
178,"I’ve traveled to every one of our 62 counties in each of the past seven years, so I know nearlyevery road, highway, bridge"
179,I also have personal experience with just about every pothole in New York – especially on theLong Island Expressway
180," I’m coming after them, too"
181,"And we are making the largest ever investment in New York’s digital infrastructure, putting $1BILLION into connecting more New Yorkers with high-speed internet"
182, This investment will boostinnovation and economic growth—especially in our most remote communities
183,There’s one more critical piece of our plan to rebuild our infrastructure — making it more resilientagainst climate change
184," Just days after being sworn into oﬃce, we were slammed with HurricaneIda"
185,"  I walked the ﬂooded streets of East Elmhurst, Queens, and witnessed the aftermath of anepic collision between Mother Nature and our inferior infrastructure, with devastatingconsequences"
186,  It was a cruel reminder that too much time has already been lost in the ﬁght against climatechange
187, These events are no longer rare – the next one is coming
188, Look no further than theUpstate counties constantly battered by “500 year” ﬂooding or the tunnels in New York City andcommunities on Long Island still undergoing repairs more than a decade after Hurricane Sandyhit
189,"This is a threat to our way of life – here and now – and that’s why we must, and will, implementan ambitious agenda to meet this moment"
190,We’ve already started with increasing the Environmental Bond Act to $4 billion to go on theballot this Fall so we have the resources we need
191,"I’m now announcing a nation-leading, $500 million investment in oﬀshore wind energy that willcreate thousands of good-paying green jobs"
192,"As we build out our wind-energy capacity, and continue our transition to clean energy, ourreliance on fossil fuels must be phased out"
193," In September, I announced two clean energy mega-projects to put us on a path to achieve the ambitious goal of cutting 80%  of New York City’spower plant emissions by 2030"
194," New construction in the State will be zero-emission by 2027,and we will build climate-friendly, electric homes and promote electric cars, trucks, and buses"
195,Protecting our environment is personal to me
196," I was born at a time, and in a place, where orangesmoke billowed out of factory smokestacks literally blocking the skies, with a horrible stench Ican still recall to this day while also dumping toxic waste into one of the world’s largestfreshwater lakes"
197,I lived surrounded by the causes of climate change – and now I’m living with its eﬀects
198,"Now, while we confront the climate crisis – we will address one of the most basic of humanneeds, that is to feel safe, on streets, in schools and in homes"
199,"Time and again, New Yorkers tell me that they don’t feel safe, that they don’t like what they seeon the streets and that things feel diﬀerent right now – and not for the better"
200,It’s not just New York City – it’s cities across America
201," Many factors contribute to our streetsfeeling less safe, including the very real uptick in gun violence nationwide since the start of thepandemic"
202,"Now, this isn’t a return to the dark days of the 70s, ’80s and ’90s"
203, But that’s not our metric forsuccess
204, We need to get back on track
205," In October, I signed a bill that closed loopholes in gun possession and registration, making iteasier for law enforcement to track down weapons used in crimes and prevent gun traﬃcking"
206,   And we banned the sale of ghost guns
207," Going forward, we will double down on practical, provenlaw enforcement strategies to combat gun violence"
208," Working with Mayor Adams and theLieutenant Governor, who I’ve asked to take the lead for our Administration, we will form a newconsortium between the New York State Police, the NYPD and other law enforcement agencies,including neighboring states to trace guns used in crimes and stop the ﬂow of guns into ourState"
209,We will triple the resources for both our gun-tracing eﬀorts as well as for successful community-based programs
210,"  Fighting gun violence is critical, but we must address other factors contributing to tthe pervasiveunease many are feeling on our streets"
211,That includes the humanitarian crisis unfolding before us: the rise in street homelessness
212, Ourfellow New Yorkers who are in this situation deserve our compassion and they will receive it –along with our support
213,"We will create teams of mental health professionals and social workers, who will partner withNew York City outreach workers, to reach homeless individuals and move them into shelters andhousing"
214,"At the same time, we know that street homelessness only accounts for a small fraction of thehomeless population"
215,"Beyond those sleeping on the streets, tens of thousands more people move in and out ofshelters as they try to secure a place to call home and tragically many of them are children"
216,"We need to focus on addressing the root causes of homelessness unmet mental health needs:poverty, addiction, and housing insecurity"
217," Every New Yorker deserves access to aﬀordable housing, whether they are at risk ofhomelessness or simply struggle to pay the rent on time each month"
218,"So many people not only face tremendous economic hardship, but the double hit is that housingprices have also continued to escalate beyond the reach of many, worsening the situation evenmore"
219,"That is why I am launching a new, ﬁve-year housing plan to create and preserve 100,000aﬀordable homes, including 10,000 units with supportive services for high-risk populations, likerunaway youth and formerly incarcerated individuals"
220,And we can no longer ignore the plight of NYCHA residents living in sometimes deplorableconditions
221, The Lieutenant Governor and I will work with the City of New York and the Legislatureon concrete action this session
222, We’ll also ﬁx outdated land use laws that hold back housingsupply
223,We’ll encourage transit-oriented development and the conversion of hotels and oﬃces tohousing is also part of our housing strategy
224,Accomplishing everything I’ve proposed hinges on one thing a government people trust
225,"Across the country, trust in government is reaching all-time lows"
226, We know why
227," Misinformationand lies on social media a widening partisan divide, gridlock in Washington even outright attackson the right to vote"
228,It’s getting harder and harder for people to believe in their elected oﬃcials at all levels ofgovernment
229,"The question is: How do we restore their faith?Here in New York, our answer is to demonstrate what good and honest governance looks like"
230,And we’ve already announced our ﬁrst step
231,We are submitting a proposal to the legislature to enact two term limits for Statewide oﬃcials
232," For government to work, those of us in power cannot continue to cling to it"
233,We need to continually pass the baton to new leaders with diﬀerent perspectives and freshideas
234,Our reforms include a ban on outside income for Statewide oﬃcials because our only job shouldbe to serve the people of New York
235,But that’s not the only part of the system that’s not working
236,"It’s no secret that recent events have called into question the eﬀectiveness of the JointCommission on Public Ethics, JCOPE"
237,I will introduce legislation to replace that commission with a new ethics enforcement watchdog
238,One with real teeth
239, One that answers to New Yorkers – not to politicians
240,None of these changes will ﬁx our government overnight and having these safeguards in placewon’t mean those of us in elected oﬃce won’t stumble or make honest mistakes
241,"But by putting much-needed reforms in place, we can at least begin to restore public trust byfocusing on what REALLY matters to our residents"
242,What you’ve just heard is a mere sampling of the more than 220 proposals that ﬁll a book we’rereleasing today
243,Quite an extraordinary accomplishment given our 134 days in oﬃce
244,And I commend the hard-working staﬀ who helped me shape this agenda— I’m proud to havethe most diverse… talented team New York State has ever had
245,Before we leave here and get to work
246,I want to pause a moment to reﬂect on our State’s unique story and the destiny that lies beforeus
247," Since its beginning, our country has attracted people from around the world, in search of an idealthat made leaving their homeland worth the risk"
248,Two simple words: American Dream
249,"And in pursuit of this, millions found their way here, to us"
250,"New York has always meant the promise of a better life, for those immigrating through EllisIsland, ﬂeeing slavery in the South, or resettling here as refugees from Afghanistan"
251,"Our state is nationally recognized as the birthplace of movements for equality and progress, thelabor movement, the women’s rights movement, the LGBTQ+ movement, the environmentalmovement, the racial justice movement, they all were started HERE by enlightened New Yorkers"
252,"We attract the best, the brightest and the boldest"
253," We embrace and celebrate racial, ethnic andgender diversity, culture and entertainment, where a single word like Broadway says it all"
