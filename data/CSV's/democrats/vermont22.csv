12,"The Governor also emphasized the need to invest in safe and healthy communities, committing tofund additional support for mental health systems and to further address the overdose epidemic,while supporting public safety and helping communities grow with signiﬁcant investments in ourdowntowns, infrastructure, and focus on smart regulatory reform"
13,The speech concluded with the Governor calling on all elected ofﬁcials to rise above election yearpolitics and focus on doing the work Vermonters have entrusted to them
14,"A transcript of Governor Scott’s address is included below:Madam President, Madam Speaker, Mr"
15," Chief Justice, members of the General Assembly, and fellowVermonters:It is our tradition at the opening of the legislative session to come together and chart our course forthe work ahead"
16,"Whether in times of peace or war, prosperity or depression, those who came before us felt the samehope and optimism we share today, ready to do the work to take on new problems and solve thosethat have eluded us for years"
17,It is a day I have been a part of many times
18," I have delivered, presided over, or sat through 21 ofthese addresses"
19," And I have always felt that on this day, with all of us together, anything is possible"
20,"In this moment, we get to decide where we will focus over the coming months, which challengeswe’ll work on and those we’ll set aside to do what is best for our fellow Vermonters"
21,***It has been almost two years since we were last together in one room
22," I know your decision tolegislate remotely was a difﬁcult one, but it was the right one, for now"
23, And it proves that ourgovernment – through great adversity – can and will move forward
24,"But I think most agree remote legislating doesn’t have the same energy and emotion, comradery,cooperation, and occasional conﬂict that are essential for good policy making"
25,"And it’s left many feeling a bit nostalgic for the chance to see friends, even those we don’t alwaysagree with; for the ideas that come up in cafeteria conversations and go on to become bills and thenhttps://governor"

28,"Friends, we will get through this and be back together soon"
29," But for now, I know we will ﬁnd a wayto take on our challenges, to see them through, and to make a difference for those we serve"
30, ***There is no doubt the last 21 months have been difﬁcult
31," But if we are willing to make the most ofthe silver linings, there is much to be gained"
32,Thanks to the work of our Congressional Delegation – especially Senator Leahy – we’ve receivedbillions in federal aid
33," And with that aid, we came together to fund signiﬁcant needs"
34,"We rolled up our sleeves to achieve the highest vaccination rates in the country and then kept themrolled up, went to work, and passed historic investments in housing, broadband, climate change,water and sewer, and economic recovery – dedicating over $600 million to transform communities,large and small, across the state"
35,"I am pleased to report that nearly half of this funding has already been approved for release, withpublic servants in just about every agency moving projects forward every day"
36, And that is on top ofthe more than $500 million we spent on infrastructure through our typical funding sources
37,These investments will help reverse decades of economic inequity in every single county
38,"This has put us on a new path, creating more opportunities for the future than most of us thoughtpossible just a few short years ago"
39,"For these reasons, I can report to you today that the State of the State is strong"
40,"And we are growing stronger every day, so that every new generation in every county and everycommunity is healthier, better educated, and more secure and prosperous than those who camebefore"
41,"***To get there, we must be clear about the challenges we face, the problems we must solve, and thepeople and places that need our help most"

45," We know the next severalweeks are going to be incredibly challenging across the country, and we’ll be focused on this issue"
46,"But for today, let’s focus on the future"
47,Because we have to learn to manage life with this virus and cannot let it derail us from addressingour most fundamental challenges: Our desperate need for more people in our communities andmore workers to ﬁll the tens of thousands of jobs available in Vermont today
48,"In January 2020, when the new virus was just a ﬂeeting mention on the nightly news, I stood beforeyou and shared my biggest concern: That for years our working-age population and the number ofkids in our schools had been shrinking unsustainably, creating deep economic inequity between thenorthwestern part of our state and everywhere else"
49,I reported at the time that only three counties had added workers while the other 11 had lost them
50,"Today, all 14 have lost workers, even Chittenden"
51," And Windsor, Windham, Caledonia, Bennington,Essex and Rutland are down 15% or more since their peak"
52," Statewide, we have seen our workforcedecrease by nearly 30,000 since 2010"
53,"It’s clear that while the pandemic didn’t create this problem, it has made it much, much worse"
54,"***The hardest part of addressing our workforce shortage is that it is so intertwined with other bigchallenges, from affordability and education to our economy and recovery"
55," Each problem makes theothers harder to solve, creating a vicious cycle that’s been difﬁcult to break"
56,"Speciﬁcally, I believe our high cost of living has contributed to a declining workforce and stuntedour growth"
57," As we lose Vermonters who cannot afford to live, do business, or even retire here, thatburden – from taxes and utility rates to healthcare and education costs – falls on fewer and fewer ofus, making life even less affordable"
58, With fewer working families comes fewer kids in our schools
59," But lower enrollment hasn’t meantlower costs and from district to district, kids are not offered the same opportunities, like foreignlanguages, AP courses, or electives"
60," And with fewer school offerings, it is hard to attract families,workers, and jobs to those communities"
61,"Fewer workers and fewer students mean our businesses struggle to ﬁll the jobs they need tosurvive, deepening the economic divide from region to region"

65,***But here’s the good news: This is the moment we’ve been waiting for and working towards
66,"We’ve been making headway on these issues for the last ﬁve years, putting ourselves in a positionto reverse our workforce trends, revitalize every county in our state, and secure the future we’veenvisioned:One where Vermonters can ﬁnd a good job, a good school, and an affordable home in each of our 14counties and 251 cities, towns, and villages"
67, Where kids in the smallest communities have as manyopportunities as kids in the largest
68, Where young families can afford to enjoy all our state has tooffer
69," And where a strong economy generates the tax revenue to easily serve all people, protect thevulnerable, and invest in the things we care about most"
70,I am more optimistic than I have ever been that this future is within our grasp
71," But we have got towork together, so we do not squander this once-in-a-life time opportunity to truly transform ourstate"
72,"Five years ago, I said, “when you are in a hole, stop digging"
73,"” My friends, today I am happy to report:We are out of that hole, and we are sitting on a pile of bricks, mortar, lumber, and steel"
74,"So, let’s grab hold, and start building"
75,*** Now we know this will not be easy
76, It is going to take all of us committing to this goal and pulling inthe same direction
77,And I want to acknowledge up front that I will not have all the answers
78, Many solutions will comefrom local communities and legislative committees
79,You can expect proposals on my end to be geared towards workforce
80," Because whether it is trainingand recruitment, childcare, tax policy, housing, healthcare, infrastructure, or climate change, wemust reverse our workforce trends"
81,"And just so we are clear, for any legislation to have my support, it cannot make this problem worse"

85,"***So, let’s start with the people already here and do more to connect them with great jobs"
86,"First, our internship, returnship, and apprenticeship programs have been incredibly successful, notonly giving workers job experience, but also building ties to local employers"
87," To improve on thiswork, the Department of Labor assists employers to ﬁll and manage internships statewide and we’llinvest more to help cover interns’ wages"
88,And let’s not forget about retired Vermonters who want to go back to work and have a lot to offer
89, Ilook forward to working with Representative Marcotte and the House Commerce Committee onthis issue and may others
90,"Next, let’s put a greater focus on trades training"
91, And here’s why:We all know we need more nurses and healthcare workers
92," And as I previewed with SenatorSanders and Senator Balint earlier this week, I will propose investments in this area"
93," But if we don’thave enough CDL drivers, mechanics and technicians, hospital staff won’t get to work; there will beissues getting the life-saving equipment and supplies we need; and we will see fewer EMTs availableto get patients to emergency rooms"
94," If we don’t have enough carpenters, plumbers and electricians,or heating, ventilation, air handling and refrigeration techs, there are fewer to construct andmaintain the facilities in our healthcare system or build homes for the workers we are trying toattract"
95,"If we make smart changes to current policy, we can open the door to Career and TechnicalEducation, giving kids multiple paths to a lucrative career and ﬁlling these crucial jobs"
96,"But more importantly, we need to do more to encourage students to pursue these programs"
97," And Ican say from my own personal experience, it is not easy to choose the CTE track, even when it isyour passion"
98,"For far too long, we have not done enough to point students toward these great opportunities tobuild a real future for themselves"
99, It is time we end the stigma around CTE
100," Because the fact is,many of the smartest, most successful people I know are in the trades"

104,"***Our strategy to grow the workforce cannot just be about training, it must be about meeting theneeds of families"
105," That’s why my workforce proposals also include things like housing, affordability,and jobs"
106,"Twice over the last ﬁve years, we have passed the largest investments in housing in the state’shistory"
107,"Last year, we focused heavily on permanent housing for homeless Vermonters"
108," As a result, we havebuilt about 800 new affordable units with another 800 under development"
109," And we have helpedover 1,300 struggling families transition out of homelessness, giving them the dignity and securityof permanent homes to regain their independence"
110,"And to help with heating costs and reduce emissions, we are working to deploy the $20 million inweatherization funds passed last year"
111,"This is important but it is not enough, and it does not get at the heart of our problem: the lack ofdecent, affordable homes for middle income families"
112,"Without it, workers we have can’t afford to move up and the workers we want can’t afford to movein"
113,We must recognize housing policy is workforce policy
114," If you will work with me in budgetadjustment to allocate $80 million more, we can show we are fully committed to this cause"
115," And inthe budget I will present in two weeks, you can expect to see another $100 million – because it’stime get serious about putting the beneﬁts of a good home and a good investment within the reachof every Vermonter"
116,***Housing is not the only area that remains unaffordable
117, Our ﬁscal discipline over the last ﬁve years– including multiple budgets that did not raise taxes or fees – narrowed the gap between theincreasing costs of state government and growth in paychecks

121," So, we should do our part to keep the costs of government policies from rising faster thanpeoples’ wages"
122," Because when these costs rise faster, we are pushing people down the economicladder"
123," But when take-home pay is growing faster than these costs, we are helping people move up"
124,"So, I will put forward a balanced and progressive tax relief package with a focus on those who needit, like retirees, middle income families and young workers"
125,We all want to see Vermonters take home more in their paychecks and for every family to havesome breathing room once their bills are paid
126," If we work together, we can make this happen thissession"
127," ***We know we need more workers, and that also means we need to keep the good jobs we have andadd more of them"
128,"That is why I will propose expanding the Capital Investment Grant program, which we created with$10 million last year, but we received applications for six times that amount"
129," This program is helpingemployers, like childcare and senior centers, museums, theaters and agricultural businesses,enhance their facilities and keep good jobs and services here – so let’s do more"
130,We are also continuing our work to attract new businesses from Canada with the help of our newbusiness recruitment ofﬁce in Montreal
131,"And let’s also help our most cutting-edge employers, like Northern Reliability and BetaTechnologies, become global leaders to grow our tech and climate sectors right here in Vermont"
132,"***As I have said many times, if we build the strongest Cradle to Career education system in thecountry, it will be one of the best economic development tools we could ask for"
133,And this means looking beyond a preK-12 system
134,We have worked together to increase the State’s investment in childcare by over 30% since I tookofﬁce

139," Last year we joined Senator Sanders, schools and privatepartners to take some big leaps forward"
140," Through our Summer Matters initiative, we added 30,000more summer camp slots and about 240 more weeks of programming"
141," And we will do it againbecause we should be offering these opportunities to young Vermonters, year-round"
142,"***This initiative came at a time when our kids desperately needed to reconnect with friends, getoutside and just have fun"
143,"Because we must acknowledge that many of the difﬁcult decisions we made to keep people safebefore vaccines, while necessary at the time, had negative effects"
144, These are the real-lifeconsequences we must consider when thinking about returning to restrictive pandemic measures
145,"Just look at our hospitals, where many patients are sicker and getting admitted because of deferredcare"
146," Or our mental health system, where demand for crisis services has never been higher"
147,"And when it comes to our kids, who lost out on months of full in-person instruction, not to mentionmusic, drama, sports, ﬁeld trips, dances and all those normal interactions we took for granted, thispandemic has taken a signiﬁcant toll"
148,"The strain was far too much for some, sending them to the ER for mental health needs"
149," And while itwas less severe for others, the grief was still felt"
150,"Last spring, I heard directly from students about the impact of hybrid learning"
151," A 13-year-old fromFair Haven put it best: She said, “Not being able to enjoy school and socialize with friends has madea lot of us feel lonely and down"
152,” And she asked me to “bring back some enjoyable activities sostudents will look forward to going to school
153,"”From academics to extra curriculars, we have a lot of ground to make up"
154," So, the Agency ofEducation, Department of Mental Health and schools are putting $285 million in recovery dollarsto work to address social, emotional and educational gaps"

162,"Our mental health system is facing serious stress and it is not uncommon for emergencydepartments to have many people in mental health crisis, as they await treatment"
163, Which is why wewill continue to increase the number of mental health beds throughout the state
164,"And I’ll ask you to expand our mobile crisis pilot and suicide prevention model to make sure whenour friends and family, neighbors and co-workers need us most, we have the tools to help"
165,"And while we did our best to support those struggling with addiction during the pandemic, the datais clear: It was not enough"
166," So, my budget will expand prevention, treatment and recovery efforts"
167,Supporting those dealing with substance misuse and addiction has been a priority and acommitment we have all shared for nearly a decade
168," No matter what other challenges come ourway, we cannot weaken our efforts to reduce the number of Vermonters struggling with drugs andalcohol, the number of families it touches, and the lives it claims"
169,"***This work not only keeps people healthier, but it also makes communities safer"
170,"As we modernize law enforcement policy, we cannot forget that police and other ﬁrst respondersare essential to public safety"
171, And this is another area where we have a signiﬁcant labor shortage
172,The work we are doing to continuously improve fair and impartial policing is necessary andimportant
173, And much of it is being led by our state and local ofﬁcers themselves
174," We have also takenmeaningful steps like universal body cameras, new training and a statewide Use of Force policy"

182, We are also working to help Montgomery with its plans for a similar projectthat will also bring jobs and housing
183," And with our investments in broadband, we will bring ﬁber topeople, who for far too long, have had little or no access to this service"
184," But only a portion of the $1billion proposal I presented was funded, so this year we will ask for the rest of it"
185,Just making the investments is not enough because it remains difﬁcult and expensive to build herein Vermont
186," So, let’s continue expanding tax credits for our downtowns"
187," And let’s add more tools torevitalize vacant, and once vibrant properties, including some of our shuttered campuses like GreenMountain College in Poultney and old industrial sites like Jones & Lamson in Springﬁeld"
188,There are many ways to strengthen our communities and we ﬁnally have the funds to do this work
