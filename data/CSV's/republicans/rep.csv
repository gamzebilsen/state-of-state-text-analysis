1," Lieutenant Governor McNally, Speaker Sexton, Speaker Pro Tem Haile, Speaker Pro Tem Marsh, Membersof the 112th General Assembly, Justices, Constitutional Officers"
2,I first want to acknowledge someone who for the last three years has been a steadfast partner to me in this journey
3,She has also been a faithful friend to Tennesseans in distressed counties through her Tennessee Serves initiative
4,"I'm so proud of the work she has done to provide underserved Tennesseans hundreds of thousands of meals, thousands ofbackpacks, and thousands of shoes for school children"
5,"Tennesseans are proud of you, and I’m proud of you, Maria, our First Lady"
6,"A spirit of humble service matters in times of trial, and it matters in times of prosperity–So I also want to thank members of myCabinet and staff who are here tonight who have served Tennesseans tirelessly over the last year"
7,I'm thankful for each one of you
8, Thank you
9,"To everyone here and to everyone listening across this state, it is the highest honor I have to serve as your governor"
10,I am grateful that you have allowed me to serve in this position
11,"We stand here today in a different place than we were a year ago, but our gratitude to Tennesseans is unchanged"
12,You have kept this state moving forward
13,"Tennesseans like the members of the National Guard who have met the worst of circumstances with grit, and yet also providedcomfort"
14,Nurses and other health care workers who have cared for the sick
15,Teachers and administrators who have taught our children
16,Troopers and police officers and sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads and keep our neighborhoods safe
17,Small businesses who have kept their doors open and workers who have worked extra hours to keep our economy moving
18,You are what makes Tennessee exceptional
19,"Last June, we commenced Untold Tennessee, a celebration of how the ordinary makes us extraordinary, to commemorate 225years of statehood"
20,Folks along the way this year have shared with me the deep connection they feel to Tennessee
21,"Folks like my friend Wally Childress, whose family owns a century farm, Childress Farms, in West Tennessee, and has grownthousands of acres of crops since 1906"
22,Wally and Tracy are with us here tonight
23, We thank you for representing generations of families that have helped make Tennesseewhat it is
24," Please stand up, Wally and Tracy Childress"
25,"For 225 years, Tennessee has been a beacon to those who wanted something more and needed a frontier to build their Americandream"
26,"In 1965, the General Assembly recognized this and passed a resolution to adopt the state slogan: “Tennessee - America at ItsBest”"
27,"Over the years, leaders have reminded Tennesseans that America at Its Best is more than our slogan - it's our north star"
28,"However, America at Its Best means something different today than it did in 1965 or even in the last decade"
29,I think about what was going on in our country in 1965 and the very real tension of becoming a more perfect Union
30,There were moments of great optimism with the passage of the Voting Rights Act
31,There were moments of tremendous innovation as Americans stepped into space
32,"Yet, there were also great challenges in 1965 as American combat troops landed in Vietnam, and the Civil Rights movementcontinued but with painfully slow progress"
33,Tennessee - America at Its Best embraces both sides of the coin: we acknowledge our shortcomings but build on our best
34,It reminds me of the truth in Scripture: Great faith is required to keep pushing for the things not yet seen
35,"Today, our country faces challenges of a different kind, but I believe now more than ever, Tennessee embodies America at Its Best"
36,"And in order to ensure that, I am proposing a budget and America at Its Best policies that reinforce freedom, innovation,exceptionalism and optimism"
37,"Freedom: Make Government Smarter & SmallerIf we are to embody America at Its Best, that starts with acknowledging that it is our Creator who endows us with freedom, and thegovernment merely maintains that freedom"
38,"I believe now more than ever, we must show great discipline and regard for our freedoms"
39,One way we do that is through a small government that contributes to a safe and well-ordered society
40,"In recent history, big government has attempted to take over society instead of contributing to it"
41,"That’s no way to live, and Tennessee has pushed back on that big government"
42,"In fact, Tennessee has recently been ranked as one of the top five freest states in the country"
43,Folks around the country see this and are moving to our state in record numbers
44,They are fleeing states with rising crime and plummeting support for police
45,Bob and Darcy Armanino each served in the San Francisco Police Department for over 30 years
46," They recently packed upeverything they had and left behind everything they’d known, in search, as they say, of more freedom"
47, And they moved right downthe road from me
48,"Bob and Darcy are our new California neighbors, and they represent thousands of new neighbors"
49," They are here with us tonight,and we welcome them as new Tennesseans"
50, Please stand and be recognized
51,Law enforcement officials from across the country see Tennessee as a destination for more freedom
52,"Just late last year, we put out a call to officers from New York to LA who were facing restrictive mandates, and they responded"
53,We welcome these new Tennesseans who are committed to keeping our neighborhoods safe
54,My budget adds 100 additional Highway Patrol Troopers and 50 new personnel to support the mission of the TBI
55,We will also commit more than $150 million directly into law enforcement agencies to create safer neighborhoods through theviolent crime intervention grant fundviolent crime intervention grant fund
56,We are proposing more than $350 million that will support a new law enforcement training academy to ensure we have the mostprofessional force in the country
57,Our funding commitment shows a respect for the rule of law but a rejection of the defund the police movement that we have seenacross the country
58,Both drug trafficking and human trafficking are on the rise in our country and in Tennessee
59,This is unacceptable
60,"Last Wednesday, I spoke to 50 Tennessee National Guard soldiers the day before they were deployed to the Southern Border tofight the flow of fentanyl that is killing Tennesseans"
61,These men and women are deploying at a time when Border chaos is at an all-time high
62," America desperately needs our stability,especially on the Southern Border"
63,I thank Lt
64, Governor McNally and Speaker Sexton for their early support of this mission as it directly impacts the health and safetyof our state
65,We will continue our anti-human trafficking investments as Tennessee sends a loud message that those who participate in humantrafficking will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
66,I also believe that communities of faith are critical to the preservation of American freedom
67,"Last year, I met with a group of Jewish leaders who conveyed their worries about safely worshiping while antisemitism is on therise"
68,"Recently, a shocked world watched as a Texas synagogue was taken hostage"
69,The rabbi credited the outcome to extensive safety training through partnership with their local law enforcement agency
70,"I have directed the Department of Safety and Homeland Security to create a plan so that every house of worship in our state canreceive high quality safety training, and we will continue to protect Tennesseans’ ability to worship freely"
71,A strong commitment to public safety includes a wise approach to criminal justice
72,I want to thank the General Assembly for the criminal justice legislation that was passed last year
73,"In the last three years, we have expanded educational pathways"
74, We have ensured every inmate has a photo ID
75, We haveincreased job opportunities for inmates
76,"Evidence clearly shows small efforts make a large impact on public safety, and we will build upon that"
77,I recently had the remarkable privilege of placing a life-changing phone call with a man who served his time in prison and was backin society
78," In fact, he’s a pastor now, here in Tennessee"
79," But, he was living with many of the burdens that currently exist for thosepreviously incarcerated"
80," It was a call to grant clemency, but it ended up being a reminder to me that people who have served theirdebt to society for the mistakes that they have made can absolutely become productive, contributing citizens to their community ifill jtlthwe will just clear a path"
81,"Pastor Quantel Lindsey and his wife Kaley are here with us tonight, and we are honored that you are"
82, Please stand and berecognized
83, I am honored you are here
84,"Innovation: Investing in the Future of TennesseeThe freedom to innovate requires a healthy balance sheet, but unfortunately, that’s not something we’re seeing at the national level"
85,The national debt recently surpassed $29 trillion
86,"That amounts to more than $220,000 per household"
87,We pay a staggering $900 million per day in national debt interest payments
88,"This is a bipartisan problem working within a broken system, but states with balanced budgets offer a guide to what could be ifWashington would just act"
89,"While Washington saddles our kids with trillions of dollars of debt, Tennessee’s strong fiscal position allows us to instead invest ontheir behalf"
90,"Education, health care, infrastructure, and economic development - all areas where we can make smart and strategic investmentsthat most states cannot"
91,"In Tennessee, we’ve also prioritized efficiency"
92,"Unlike many other states, since I’ve taken office, our employee headcount at our departments has actually reduced by five percentwithout making layoffs"
93,I thank members of the General Assembly for being partners in this prudent management approach
94,"While some are forecasting a recession, we remain prepared with a healthy savings account and minimal liabilities"
95,Our proposed budget will boost the Rainy-Day Fund to a highest-ever $1
96,6 billion
97,We have the financial capacity to innovate and approach key areas like education and infrastructure with fresh eyes
98,"With the support of thousands of Tennessee parents, I am committing to updating the 30 year-old way we fund our K-12 publicschools"
99,"I'm proposing an innovative approach that sets aside dollars for each student, based on their individual needs, and these dollarswill be used in whatever public school they attend"
100,"We have spent months engaging parents, teachers, students and stakeholders in a fully transparent process across the entirestate"
101,"The Department of Education and partners in the General Assembly have received thousands of public comments, including morethan 16 townhalls and meetings across the state"
102,"I thank every Tennessean who participated in the process especially those who served on our 18 subcommitteesI thank every Tennessean who participated in the process, especially those who served on our 18 subcommittees"
103,"It’s not just hundreds of millions of dollars on the line - it’s our kids, their childhoods, and most importantly their futures"
104,"Time and time again, we have heard the same message: we need a smarter, more transparent, accountable education fundingformula, and the time is now"
105,"A formula that prioritizes the needs of students above all else, and that pays particular attention to students with disabilities, ruralstudents, low income-students, and students with other priority needs"
106,"If we do this correctly, we can create a funding formula that demands accountability and rewards districts for performance, but mostimportantly funds students and not bureaucracies"
107,"If we do this right, then and only then, can we feel confident investing the dollars that are needed for our public schools and thefuture of Tennessee"
108,"Therefore, in tandem with this new funding formula, I am proposing $1 billion in new, recurring education spending for our publicschools across Tennessee"
109," The proposal will be finalized in the coming days, and I look forward to working with you, the membersof the General Assembly, to get this done"
110,This budget also includes one-time funding to expand high school and middle school career and technical opportunities so everystudent can graduate with the industry credential they need to join the workforce of tomorrow
111,"Let me tell you what else this one-time funding will be used for: I went to Waverly, TN after the devastating floods late last year"
112,"The tragedy, the heartache, the loss was hard to take in"
113, I walked into the elementary school where the water rose to four feet in 10minutes
114,I saw desks and backpacks and books piled up against the door where water rushed out
115," If the Waverly flood happened on Fridayinstead of Saturday, we would be mourning the loss of hundreds of Tennessee children"
116,I am proposing one-time funding to ensure that no student in Tennessee attends a public school located in a flood zone
117,"While we are improving our funding strategy, we also need to empower parents with a candid look into not only how their childrenare learning but what they are learning"
118,"The vast majority of parents believe they should be allowed to see books, curriculum and other items used in the classroom"
119,"That’s how I felt about my own kids, and I stand with those parents today"
120,We are proposing a new law that will ensure parents know what materials are available to students in their libraries
121,This law will also create greater accountability at the local level so parents are empowered to make sure content is age-appropriate
122,"As we again work to make gains in elementary reading and mathematics, we will work to ensure students have tailored options inscience, technology, engineering and technical training"
123,We will grow our investment in the Future Workforce Initiative by $2
124,5 million and will propose new legislation to make computerscience and coding available to every high school student in Tennesseescience and coding available to every high school student in Tennessee
125,We are seeing steady enrollment in our Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology when other academic disciplines havedeclined
126,"These Tennesseans stand ready to wire our houses, build our cars and nurse our sick back to health"
127," We need them on the jobnow, not on a waitlist"
128,"So, I am committing $200 million in TCAT expansions to help double our skilled workforce by 2026 and ensure that anyTennessean wishing to further their education can immediately enroll in a TCAT"
129,"Make no mistake - Tennessee is “Working People USA,” and we will do whatever it takes to train and retrain Tennesseans so thatboth our businesses and our families can thrive"
130,The keepers of “Working People USA” have been our teachers
131,"When companies look to Tennessee for a pipeline of skilled workers, it is teachers who are busy preparing students for life beyondthe classroom"
132,"We should raise teacher pay this year by $125 million, which is a well-deserved increase into the teacher salary pool"
133,"Historically, funds put in the salary pool don’t always make it to deserving teachers"
134," When we say teachers are getting a raise,there should be no bureaucratic workaround to prevent that"
135,"In our updated funding formula, we will ensure a teacher raise is a teacher raise"
136,Increasing wages isn’t enough to address a teacher shortage and record number of retirements
137,"In 2020, we launched a program to get more high school seniors to pursue teaching and even remain within the communities thatraised them"
138,"Our program, called Grow Your Own, is now nationally recognized as a model for building a pipeline of qualified educators"
139,"It is the first time teaching has been recognized by the federal government as an apprenticeship pathway, and that path starts righthere in Tennessee"
140,The Grow Your Own model is proof that giving kids real skills and a roadmap will solve the greatest challenges of the day
141,So much of innovation begins with doing research and committing to reaching full potential
142,"At the higher education level, we’re investing $90 million in our nationally-highlighted outcomes-based funding formula"
143,"With this level of funding, I would expect zero tuition increases for our public universities"
144,We are also proud to propose a series of research investments to ensure we stay on track to be America at Its Best
145,"Recently, the University of Memphis received a Carnegie R1 designation making it a top-tier school for research"
146,We will now have what’s known as an R1 institution in each grand division
147,"We are proposing $50 million toward a research endowment to propel work that will make Memphis a global leader in AgriTech,cybersecurity, and the digital workforce"
148,Meeting our full potential also means being home to some of the best historically black colleges and universities in the country
149,"Back in November 2020, the Speakers appointed a Joint Land Grant Committee, chaired by Representative Harold Love, toexplore how the state can better understand the new needs of Tennessee State University"
150,"Today, I'm recommending a $250 million dollar investment to improve the physical infrastructure at TSU"
151,Our commitment to innovation will continue east right through the Oak Ridge corridor
152,"We’re investing more than $70 million to complete the Oak Ridge Innovation Institute, which is a partnership with the University ofTennessee to invest in data science, technology, advanced materials, and much more"
153,"For decades, East Tennessee has been home to some of the best kept secrets in nuclear energy and American innovation"
154,"Today, many may not realize that Tennessee derives more power from nuclear energy than from any other source"
155,"Recently, I visited the TVA’s Watts Bar nuclear facility, the last nuclear facility to be built in America, to see firsthand how nuclearpower keeps our grid dependable even when the weather is not"
156,Nuclear power is clean energy that actually works for the private sector
157,"It has enabled us to land major economic projects because not only is it clean, but it is also cheap to produce"
158,"Tennessee’s expanded nuclear potential rests at the Clinch River site as one of the few undeveloped, certified nuclear sites in thecountry"
159,We are working directly with TVA to formalize a long-term strategy so the Clinch River site can be part of powering America
160,"If we’re going to have a real conversation about energy in America, it needs to be safe, cheap to produce, and reliable"
161, I believethat conversation starts right here in Tennessee at the Clinch River site
162,Our state is one of the fastest growing states in the country
163,We have an obligation to future generations to invest in our roads and bridges to accommodate that economic growth
164,My budget proposes accelerating the IMPROVE Act by allocating $100 million to ensure progress on critical projects
165,"I'm also proposing more than $170 million toward interchange improvements in 12 counties across the state that will propeleconomic growth in rural areas, because if we want to look at what’s right about America, we’ve got to look at rural Tennessee"
166,I'm also proposing more than $250 million toward road infrastructure projects in the fastest growing counties
167,"All of these amount to well over $600 million additional dollars invested in road infrastructure, over and above what was already inplace, and that is what meeting our obligation to the future looks like"
168,"Exceptionalism: Preserving What’s Best About AmericaEarlier, I mentioned Tennesseans are what make our state exceptional"
169,"I recently watched President Reagan’s farewell address, made just before he left office in January of 1989"
170,"As many other Presidents have done, his farewell address includes a warning to the American people"
171,He reminds us that what we want to have in this country is “informed patriotism
172,"”Then, speaking about American history, he says, “If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are"
173,"”He said, “I'm warning of an eradication of the American memory that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American spirit"
174,”But he offered a solution by saying: “Let's start with some basics: more attention to American history and a greater emphasis oncivic ritual
175,"”Some 30 years later, those words are still true, and now more than ever, it is important that we teach true American history,unbiased and non-political"
176,"Two years ago, we launched the Governor’s Civics Seal program which included grants to support public schools implementinghigh-quality civic education programs"
177,"Since then, we’ve nearly tripled the size of the program, and thousands of Tennessee students have received this education, andwe expect the opportunity to grow"
178,The Fordham Institute recently ranked us as one of the top five states for civics education
179,I’m proud of the “informed patriots” graduating from our Tennessee schools
180,"But there is still more to do, especially if we want to provide Tennessee parents with more educational choices"
181,"Two years ago, I traveled to Hillsdale College to participate in a Presidents Day celebration and spend time with champions ofAmerican exceptionalism"
182,"For decades, Hillsdale College has been the standard bearer in quality curriculum and the responsibility of preserving Americanliberty"
183,"I believe their efforts are a good fit for Tennessee, and we are formalizing a partnership with Hillsdale to expand their approach tocivics education and K-12 education"
184,Informed patriotism should stretch beyond the K-12 classroom and into higher education
185,"In many states, colleges and universities have become centers of anti-American thought, leaving our students not only ill-equippedbut confused"
186,"But, in Tennessee, there’s no reason why our institutions of higher learning can’t be an exceptional part of America at Its Best"
187,I’m including in my budget $6 million to establish the Institute of American Civics at the University of Tennessee
188,"This will be a flagship for the nation - a beacon celebrating intellectual diversity at our universities and teaching how a responsible,civic-minded people strengthens our country and our communities"
189,"However, our universities not only face internal threats, but are facing very real external threats as foreign powers target them tosteal or influence American research"
190,"The federal government estimates more than $225 billion worth of intellectual property is stolen each year by China, much of this atinstitutions of higher learning"
191,"Last year, we shut down Confucius Institutes at our public Tennessee universities to cut ties with an organization that is working forthe Chinese Communist Party"
192,The State of Tennessee has to remain vigilant with regard to countries and foreign entities who don’t have our best interests inmind
193,Our administration has also strengthened our vetting approach to ensure we do not spend state dollars or incentivize any companydoing the work of foreign adversaries
194,"We’re doing this to protect our Tennessee economy, our taxpayer dollars and our American security"
195,"Our state will continue to be a destination for other global companies who are honest brokers, and we welcome them to the table"
196,Good faith partnership is core to the American spirit
197,"And while we welcome foreign investment, we also welcome individuals from other countries who have legally made Americahome, and that is something we should always value"
198,It’s been said that Americans by birth need to spend time with Americans by choice from time to time to help remind us all of whatmakes this country so exceptional
199,An American by choice who has impacted me is Rocky Ghazi
200, He is a Kurdish refugee from Iraq and a proud American citizen bychoice
201, He also serves our state as a trooper in the Tennessee Highway Patrol
202,"Rocky and his wife Jeehan are here with us tonight, and we’re proud that you call Tennessee home"
203, Please stand and berecognized
204,Optimism: Best State for FamiliesTennessee fulfills America at Its Best because of our optimism
205,"Optimism that our best days are ahead of us, and that we can be the best place in the world for families to form and thrive"
206,My office has proposed and supported some of the soundest pro-life legislation in the country
207,"Thanks to our partners in the legislature, we passed thoughtful laws that protected the unborn and supported expecting mothers"
208,"If the federal courts return full authority to the states, Tennessee’s laws will automatically provide the maximum possible protectionand offer a glimmer of redemption as America reconciles our troubled past"
209,I believe Tennessee can be a major part of that reconciliation by offering both hope and resources to families in crisis
210,This begins with mothers and continuing big investments in their health
211,TennCare’s Health Starts Initiative will now have the funding to put an even greater emphasis on maternal health and holistic carefor mothers and children
212,"Our support for families will continue through Tennessee Fosters Hope, where we have certified new foster families, offered traumatraining statewide, recruited ""foster friendly"" businesses, and moved many children into forever homes"
213,I'm proposing the funding of relative caregiver placements which will allow extended families to keep loved ones close by
214," We arealso proposing a childcare support program for all foster families, regardless of their DHS eligibility"
215,You can’t be the best state for families unless you’re the best state for all families
216, I believe we have significant work to do inimproving access to health care for Tennessee families
217,"Because of our prudent fiscal management, we’re making huge investments in rural healthcare in this budget"
218," And that meansactual care, not just keeping hospitals open"
219,"We need qualified, dedicated physicians and staff in rural areas"
220,We are dedicating more than $18 million to attract 150 new primary care residents for rural Tennessee
221,"Because of the confidence we have in our block grant waiver, we are able to make significant investments in health care, includingan additional $55 million in our Medicaid Pathways to Independence program"
222,This simply means more benefits and smarter spending for our TennCare population
223,"We are dramatically expanding dental care for more than 600,000 TennCare recipients through a $25 million dollar investment andworking on a multi-year commitment to broaden dental services across the state"
224,It’s no secret that the opioid epidemic has ravaged many of our communities all across Tennessee
225,"Therefore, we are increasing investment to support addiction recovery through mobile units and improved walk-in care"
226,"In spite of this challenge of opioid addiction, we are at a hopeful moment thanks to a tireless fighter who serves our state"
227,Our Attorney General Herbert Slatery has worked to ensure every county in Tennessee is entitled to part of the $26 billion dollarsuit against pharmaceutical companies who fueled the opioid tragedy
228,General Slatery is a national leader who was recently recognized as the Best Attorney General in America
229," General Slatery, pleasestand, and let Tennesseans say thank you for all you have done"
230,"From education to infrastructure,From economic development to healthcare,This budget is bold and balanced, and most importantly, it doesn’t ask Tennesseans for a penny more in taxes"
231,"Members of the General Assembly, the state of our state is strong, and I look forward to working with you to make it stronger, yet"
232,"ClosingTennessee is, in fact a beacon for America, a harbinger of opportunity, of security, of freedom"
233,"We are the reminder of what can be, but is not yet, very much like the formation of a more perfect Union"
234,Every child doesn’t yet have access to a high-quality education
235,Every neighborhood is not yet safe
236,Every family doesn’t yet have opportunity
237,But what I know is this
238,"Every single member of the Tennessee General Assembly, every court justice, every constitutional officer, and this governor knowsthat if anybody can do it, Tennessee can"
239,"In First Chronicles, scripture describes the leaders of ancient Israel at a particular time in its history"
240,These leaders are described as ones who understood their times and knew what they should do
241,May we be those leaders
242,May we ensure that the beacon that is Tennessee - America at Its Best - shines brighter than ever before
243,May the Lord grant His favor upon the great state of Tennessee
244, Thank you

20," With the help of many of you, we got itdone"
21, Policies do matter
22, We’ve seen our overall crime rate decline by 10 percent in 2019 and another 18
23,"5percent in 2020! According to the FBI, reported property crimes are at the lowest level since 1974"

1," Over the last four years, we have proved that to be the gospel truth by coming together to solve some of the state’s toughest challenges"
2,"  To you, the people of Alabama and the men and women of the Legislature: You are the reason for our progress"
3,"   This evening, I renew my commitment to you that we will not only continue tackling old problems"
4," We will work together as Alabamians to find new solutions so that our state is the best place to live, work and raise a family for years to come"
5,"  I am pleased to report that the state of our state is strong and that if you join me in my bold vision for the future of Alabama, I am confident that our best days are in front of us!  President Ronald Reagan once said that there are no barriers to our progress except those we erect ourselves"
6, I have found that to be true here in Alabama
7," It was up to us to decide that it’s always time to do what’s right, even if it’s not the politically popular thing to do"
8,"   When our prison system went unaddressed for decades and resulted in serious challenges, we found a way toward a solution"
9,"   When our roads and bridges were in need for desperate improvements, we found a way to make significant progress all across the state"
10,"  When our federal government overreached, we found a way to fight back"
11,"  When all of us in this room come together with the people of our state, Alabama will always find a way"

13,    Page 1 of 7 I commend the men and women of the Legislature for joining me on that mission as we moved the Alabama Prison Program across the finish line this past fall
14, I am certain this critical step will make a significant difference for decades to come
15,  I promised that our roads would be the envy of the nation
16," While our work is far from over, we have made significant progress thanks to the Rebuild Alabama Act"
17,"   As promised, every single penny has gone to road and bridge projects, as well as to our Port"
18,"  I am proud to report that on top of the local improvements, the state has administered projects in almost all 67 counties already, and like I said, we’ve only just begun"
19,"   We are delivering on decades talked-about projects like The West Alabama Corridor, which will connect Mobile all the way to Tuscaloosa with a four-lane highway"
20,  We are tackling other needed projects to increase capacity like six-laning I-10 in West Mobile from Theodore to Irvington
21,"  And tonight, I am proud to announce that we will be widening I-59 from Chalkville Mountain Road to I-459, in east Jefferson County near Trussville, from four lanes to six lanes"

26," To the rest of the nation, I say loud and clear that Alabama’s Port of Mobile is open for business!  We are proud to invite the nation and the world to do business with Alabama at our Port"
27,"   Let me also add that in Alabama, we actually know what we are talking about when we use the word “infrastructure"
28,"”   When you compare what we have accomplished by working together with what our national leaders in Washington have been doing, the difference is quite clear"

33,"   While the Legislature has stood with me in opposing these federal mandates, we have also been fortunate to have a strong leader in Attorney General Steve Marshall, who hasn’t shied away from the fight one bit"

47,"   When President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, we in Alabama quickly acted to ensure that those funds went directly into the hands of Alabamians"
48," From our small businesses to our churches, non-profits and classrooms, I am proud that working with the men and women in this room, Alabama used every cent and invested it wisely"
49,"   But even today as states like Alabama are making record economic comebacks, Congress is wanting our country to spend more and more federal dollars, and now we are tasked with allocating the American Rescue Plan Act funds"
50,   We must be smart with this one-time money and commit to the people of Alabama that we will wisely invest – not just casually spend – these dollars
51, I’ll say again that these federal dollars are just one-time funds
52, This is not “free money
53,"”  I challenge you, members of the Legislature, to make allocating these funds an early priority and to put these monies to meet some of Alabama’s biggest challenges like statewide broadband connectivity, water and sewer infrastructure, as well as investing funds in our hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers"

61,"   Our preliminary numbers for 2021, even despite all of the curveballs we have been thrown, are looking strong"
62,   It is projected that Alabama saw investments totaling $5

71,   And it doesn’t stop there
72,"   In the current push for electric vehicles, so often, what is left out of the conversation is the fact that we are having to rely on other countries for an important ingredient in producing the EV batteries"
73," Now, our country will turn to Westwater Resources in Coosa County for this critical resource in battery manufacturing"
74,"   My fellow Alabamians, Made in Alabama is committed to bringing back Made in America"
75,"  Clearly, with one of the nation’s lowest unemployment rates, Alabama is on the fast track"
76,"   On top of our second to none workforce, Alabama also has an abundance of natural beauty – from the rolling green mountains to the sparkling waters of our Gulf Coast"
77, It’s no wonder that we saw north of 1
78,2 million more visitors to our Alabama State Parks or that our state’s tourism industry just had one of the best years on record
79," I declare to you tonight that by making every effort to expand outdoor recreation and by ensuring continued developments in our hospitality industry, the future of both of these sectors is bright"

86, We must ask ourselves what more can be done to protect these brave men and women
87,"   Here in Alabama, we are funding our law enforcement officers and looking to make positive changes that benefit both officers and our communities"
88,"   Last year, I was proud to announce a partnership between the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and KultureCity"
89," Thanks to this first-of-its kind partnership, every ALEA trooper is now trained to be sensory-inclusive"

97,"   Tonight, I am speaking to you as your governor, but I also am speaking to you as someone whose career journey began as a high school civics teacher"
98,"   And as a former educator, I say that the single most important issue here in Alabama and in our nation is our children’s education"
99,"   No doubt, the covid-19 pandemic shined a light on our country’s education system in many ways"
100,   Let me be crystal clear: it is more critical than ever that every Alabama student is receiving in-person learning
101,"   Despite the fact Alabama led others states in getting kids back in the classroom, last year during this occasion, I called on our local school districts to work with community partners to close the learning gap"
102," That is why tonight, I am proud to propose funding for after school programs I know will go a long way in getting our students on track for success"
103,"  In Alabama, our students will be focused on core curriculum"
104,   That means being proficient readers by the end of third grade
105,"   After we collect useful data during this upcoming spring semester, implementing the Alabama Literacy Act will be a must"
106,"   We must also ensure our kids are focused on developing their math skills, studying history – not theory – and mastering other classes like science and writing"

113,"   This evening, I present a challenge to our schools, our communities, our citizens and our leaders"
114," We should pledge, together, that we will no longer accept the existence of a failing elementary school in our state"
115,   Early learning is the bedrock of a quality education
116," How can we expect to have successful middle and high schools if we have failing elementary schools?  To that end, I am proposing resources to support grants for failing elementary schools that are not one-size-fits-all, but rather, are customized to the particular needs of each of those struggling schools"
117,"   Folks, let me be clear"
118, Money isn’t going to fix our problems in education
119,"   Page 5 of 7 We need to work with these schools with an Alabama spirit of cooperation and determination, and we need to find new ways to address old problems"
120, That begins with making sure that every elementary school in Alabama is a successful school
121,     We will ensure we recruit and retain good teachers
122,  We are expanding funding to math and science teachers
123,"   We need more highly qualified math and science teachers if we want to improve student achievement and prepare our children for the new economy, and we must continue to work every single day toward this goal"
124,"   My fellow Alabamians, teachers along the way have made a difference in each of our lives"
125," The job of teachers is no small task, and during the height of covid, parents witnessed firsthand the adjustments and the obstacles that faced our educators"

6, Mr
7," Speaker, Mr"
8," President, members of the Legislature and fellow citizens:Together we have made Florida the freest state in these United States"
9,"While so many around the country have consigned the people’s rights to the graveyard, Florida has stood as freedom’s vanguard"
10,"In Florida, we have protected the right of our citizens to earn a living, provided our businesses with the ability to prosper, fought back againstunconstitutional federal mandates and ensured our kids have the opportunity to thrive"
11,"Florida has become the escape hatch for those chaﬁng under authoritarian, arbitrary and seemingly never-ending mandates and restrictions"
12,"Even today, across the nation we see students denied an education due to reckless, politically-motivated school closures, workers deniedemployment due to heavy-handed mandates and Americans denied freedoms due to a coercive biomedical apparatus"
13,These unprecedented policies have been as ineffective as they have been destructive
14, They are grounded more in blind adherence to Fauciandeclarations than they are in the constitutional traditions that are the foundation of free nations
15,Florida is a free state
16," We reject the biomedical security state that curtails liberty, ruins livelihoods and divides society"
17, And we will protect therights of individuals to live their lives free from the yoke of restrictions and mandates
18,Florida has stood strong as the rock of freedom
19, And upon this rock we must build Florida’s future
20,"We will, fortunately, be able to confront our challenges with an incredibly favorable budget outlook and strong economic performance that haswithstood unfavorable national headwinds:My recommended budget of $99"
21,7 billion has more than $15 billion in reserve — one of the largest surpluses in state history
22,Florida’s revenues have exceeded estimates by billions of dollars over the past year
23, December’s revenues came in at more than $500 million overthe latest monthly estimate
24,And this is all being done with no income tax and the lowest per capita tax burden in America
25,Job creation in Florida is far exceeding the national average
26, And our labor force has increased six times faster than the nation’s
27,"Florida also leads the nation in business formations, which have increased by 61% since I took ofﬁce in 2019"
28," In 2021, Florida saw 114,000 morenew businesses than second place California — even though California has a population that is 40% larger"
29,Freedom works
30, Our economy is the envy of the nation
31, And the state is well-prepared to withstand future economic turmoil
32,"Our nation is, though, facing economic problems stemming from reckless federal policies, especially the most sustained Inﬂation our country haswitnessed in decades"
33," The federal government has borrowed and printed unprecedented sums of money, and the bill is coming due"

36, It represents a pay cut for individuals and families alike
37, And one of the ways families have felt the pinch has been insigniﬁcantly higher gas prices
38,"To help alleviate this burden for Florida families, I am proposing a $1 billion gas tax holiday to help reduce prices at the pump"
39," If Washington, D"
40,C
41,",won’t change course, then we have a responsibility to step up on behalf of Floridians"
42,Education represents a major pillar of Florida’s future
43, I’m happy to note that Florida is again ranked number three for K-12 achievement in thelatest Education Week Quality Counts rankings
44," We have worked hard to keep schools open, increase teacher compensation, promote workforceeducation and protect the rights of parents"
45,"In pockets across America, schools are closing once again"
46, These closures are enormously destructive and will not be tolerated in the state ofFlorida
47,Florida has led the way in putting our kids ﬁrst
48," In the summer of 2020, when it wasn’t fashionable, we made clear that kids needed to be in school"
49," We faced opposition — from hysterical media, from unions and the politicians they control"
50," We even faced lawsuits aiming to close the schools, butwe wouldn’t allow fear or politics to harm our kids"
51, We were right and they were wrong
52, And millions of families in Florida are better for it
53,"While it is important to embrace high academic standards and to measure student achievement, the FSA test is not the best way to do it"
54, I amproposing the elimination of the FSA and replacing it with periodic progress monitoring
55," This will lead to meaningful feedback for parents andteachers and will reduce the amount of time dedicated to testing, leaving more time for learning"
56," This reform will be better for students, teachers andparents, and it will help Florida remain a leader in education reform"
57,"Over the past two years, we have increased the average minimum salary for teachers by more than $6,000"
58," And last year, we provided $1,000bonuses to every public school teacher and principal in the state"
59,Brittany Duquaine is a teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Pinellas County
60," She has beneﬁtted from the bonuses and salary increases and theexperience at Lakewood shows why this is important, as Brittany and her colleagues took the school from an F grade in 2019 to an A grade in 2021"
61,"Let’s continue this progress by further increasing teacher pay and by approving $1,000 bonuses for a second year in a row"
62,Florida has enacted a Parents’ Bill of Rights and we reject the notion that parents shouldn’t have a say in what their kids learn in school
63," Indeed,Florida law should provide parents with the right to review the curriculum used in their children’s schools"
64," We should provide parents with recourseso that state standards are enforced, such as Florida’s prohibition on infusing subjects with critical race theory in our classrooms"
65,Quisha King is a mother from Duval County who has joined moms all across Florida and America to speak out against divisive ideologies like CRT
66,These moms are standing up for a principle that is the policy of the state of Florida: Our tax dollars should not be used to teach our kids to hate ourcountry or to hate each other
67,Florida’s public college and university system is ranked number one in the nation yet again
68, Higher education must remain affordable for Floridafamilies
69," I will not support any tuition increases at Florida’s colleges and universities and I oppose cutting Bright Futures scholarships, which havebeneﬁtted many Florida families"
70,"As proud as we are of the quality and affordability of Florida’s university system, a four-year education at a traditional brick-and-ivy school isn’t theonly pathway to success"
71," Over the past three years, Florida has added more than 50 new apprenticeship programs"
72," The credentials earned throughour workforce initiatives have paved the way for employment in a variety of ﬁelds like aviation, logistics and welding"
73," These are as valuable and ashonorable endeavors as attending august universities, and they deserve our support"
74,Florida’s dedicated focus on the skilled trades will help expand the state’s manufacturing footprint
75, We have already seen businesses move herefrom other states and we should also be actively encouraging businesses to repatriate production back to America from foreign countries
76, Do wereally want our supply chains to be captive to the whims of a country such as Communist China?Florida’s economic security is also linked to the stewardship of our natural resources
77,"We Floridians are heirs to a unique environment that makes our state the envy of the nation for ﬁshing, boating and other outdoor activities"
78," Threeyears ago, we promised bold action to safeguard Florida’s natural resources, improve water quality and restore the Everglades"
79," With the support ofthe Legislature, especially Speaker Chris Sprowls and President Wilton Simpson, we have secured historic funding to support these efforts"
80,"Since January 2019, 42 Everglades restoration projects have broken ground, hit a major milestone or ﬁnished construction, record funding has goneto conduct research and secure technologies to mitigate blue-green algae and red tide, and the state now has dedicated streams of revenue topromote coastal resiliency and water quality improvements"
81,We have even made enormous strides in removing invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades
82," In the gallery today is the reigning python king,Charlie Dachton, who caught a whopping 41 pythons in our 2021 statewide contest"
83,"We resolved to leave our unique natural inheritance to God better than we found it, and we are fulﬁlling that pledge"
84,We also will continue to honor our commitment to safe communities
85,Florida is a law and order state
86,"We will not allow law enforcement to be defunded, bail to be eliminated, criminals to be prematurely released from prison or prosecutors to ignorethe law"
87,https://ﬂgov
88,"com/2022/01/11/governor-ron-desantis-state-of-the-state-address-3/2/5Governor Ron DeSantis’ State of the State Address3/20/22, 9:33 PMThese soft-on-crime policies have been tried in communities throughout the country to disastrous results: crime has skyrocketed, morale for policeofﬁcers has plummeted and quality of life has been destroyed"
89,We have stood by the men and women of law enforcement
90," Not only do we reject defunding law enforcement — we enacted $1,000 bonuses for allpolice, ﬁre and EMTs in Florida"
91, I’m asking the Legislature to re-up these bonuses for another year
92, They deserve it
93,Serving in law enforcement is a noble calling and we will not allow our ofﬁcers to be smeared by reckless politicians and corporate media
94," Myproposals to increase pay for state law enforcement by up to 25% and to provide $5,000 signing bonuses to law enforcement personnel who eithertransfer to or begin their careers in Florida will spark a tidal wave of qualiﬁed professionals seeking employment at agencies throughout the state"
95,"I’m happy to be joined by Ofﬁcer Yehuda Topper from the North Miami Beach Police Department, who moved from NYC and is the state’s ﬁrstorthodox Jewish police ofﬁcer"
96,Let there be no doubt to those who wear the uniform: the state of Florida stands with you!Law and order requires strong borders
97, The crisis at the US-Mexico border over the past year has witnessed staggering illegal migration and amassive inﬂux of narcotics like fentanyl
98," Rather than defend our sovereignty and enforce the border, the federal government has released hundredsof thousands of illegal aliens to communities across the U"
99,S
100,", shipping them to Florida at alarming rates, including by sending clandestine ﬂights inthe dark of night"
101,"As a state, we cannot be a party to what is effectively a massive human smuggling operation run by the federal government"
102," Companies who arefacilitating the movement of illegal aliens from the southern border to Florida should be held accountable, including by paying restitution to thestate for all the costs they are imposing on our communities"
103," I am also requesting funds so that when the feds dump illegal aliens in Florida, the statecan re-route them to states that have sanctuary policies"
104,Florida should not be made to bear the burden of our federal government’s lawless open border policies
105,The rule of law also means that our citizens have the ability to participate in elections that are secure and transparent
106,"It is Orwellian doublespeak to invoke the concept of “Voting rights” to mean ballot harvesting, prohibiting voter ID and taxpayer funding ofelections"
107, Those are political concepts that erode the integrity of our elections
108,Ballot harvesting has no place in Florida and we need to increase the penalties for those who do it
109," We also need to ensure that supervisors clean thevoter rolls, that only citizens are registered to vote and that mail ballots only go to those who actually request them before each individual election"
110,"To ensure that elections are conducted in accordance with the rule of law, I have proposed an election integrity unit whose sole focus will be theenforcement of Florida’s election laws"
111, This will facilitate the faithful enforcement of election laws and will provide Floridians with the conﬁdencethat their vote will count
112,Our constitutional rights have been under assault on a number of fronts and Florida has stood tall in defending the rights of its people
113,"A free society requires the ability to have robust discussions about issues of public importance, yet today Big Tech companies have used theirplatforms to elevate preferred narratives and to stiﬂe dissent, serving as a de facto council of censors"
114, Florida was the ﬁrst state to legislateprotections for its citizens and we should build on this success
115,These same companies make a fortune by selling user data
116, Floridians should not have their data utilized by Big Tech without providing afﬁrmativeconsent and I urge the Legislature to enact protections for the data privacy of all Floridians
117,I also recommend that the Legislature strengthen protections for Floridians’ 2nd Amendment rights
118, These important rights should not depend on thewhims of politicians who reject the existence of those rights
119,"Finally, we have an opportunity to strengthen protections for the right to life, without which the other rights mean little"
120,Protecting life does not end with the unborn
121, It must also include continued efforts to promote adoption and foster care so that all Floridians have afair chance in life
122," Florida has 4,000 more licensed caregivers than in 2019 and I am proposing additional funds for foster parents in next year’sbudget"
123,"Nobody has done more to support Florida’s children than our First Lady, whose Pathway to Prosperity program has served more than 17,000families in need through a collaboration between DCF and the faith community"
124,"On behalf of our family, I want to personally thank everyone who has sent prayers and well-wishes for her recovery from breast cancer"
125," Casey isstrong, resilient, and has a husband and three kids who love her dearly"
126," 2022 is the year she will be cancer free!Florida has understood how important it is to put our seniors ﬁrst, and we have done that time and again over the past two years"
127,"Most recently, we led the nation in raising awareness of and expanding access to monoclonal antibody treatments"
128, This effort has kept thousands ofseniors out of the hospital and has saved many lives
129,Wally and Doris Cortese from Cape Coral are with us today
130, Wally is a WWII and Korean War veteran who has been married to Doris for 62 years
131,"When they both contracted COVID-19, they utilized monoclonal treatments to make full recoveries"
132, God bless you both

140,"One of the victims was 92 year old the Hilda Noriega, whose son, North Bay Village Chief of Police Carlos Noriega, and grandchildren are with ustoday"
141, Hilda was the matriarch of an amazing family and is dearly missed by those who knew her
142,"The grief and anguish endured by the Noriega family and the other Surfside families has been overwhelming, and reminds us that:“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those whose spirits are crushed"
143,”Our state should provide support for an appropriate memorial so that future generations will never forget the legacies of the victims of that terribleevent
144,The Surfside tragedy reminds us that you never know what tomorrow will bring
145, Don’t take anything for granted and make the most out of each andevery day

19,We are a state forged by the Wisconsin Idea -- the notion that education informs our public policy and that knowledge should embrace thecommunities we're called to serve

31, And the state of our state is more than just our unemployment rate

59, We talked aboutpolicies and solutions that connect the dots
60,And I keep saying that -- connecting the dots -- and I’ve been asked several times what I mean by that -- it’s about seeing a forest through the trees
61,It’s about seeing the connection between how lack of access to aﬀordable housing aﬀects kids in the classroom
62, It’s about seeing the connectionbetween drug and alcohol addiction and our burgeoning criminal justice system
63, It’s about seeing the connection between a budding entrepreneurwho wants to start their own business and how the rising costs of health insurance might push that dream out of reach

71," For the past decade,we’ve not only cut funding for public schools, we've failed to fully fund services for special education"
72, This has forced local school districts andtaxpayers to squeeze resources from other areas to provide these critical services
73, Our budget will provide an unprecedented $600 million-dollarincrease in special education funding
74, That means our school districts will have enough to allocate the resources they do have to other areas of highneed

86,We’ve already started working to make sure healthcare in Wisconsin is aﬀordable and accessible
87, We signed executive orders creating a HealthyCommunities Initiative and calling upon the Department of Health Services to prioritize these goals
88, We also called upon our state agencies toconnect the dots and work together on how we can protect healthcare coverage for people in our state
89,But our work can’t stop there
90, That’s why our budget will also seek to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin
91," According to the nonpartisan Legislative FiscalBureau, this will enable an additional 76,000 Wisconsinites to have access to aﬀordable healthcare"
92," This would also save Wisconsin taxpayershundreds of millions of dollars, allowing us to reallocate those cost savings to other critical programs"
93,"ADVERTISEMENT News Weather Sports Health Small TownsWe have a real opportunity here, folks"
94," At the end of the day, Mr"
95, Majority Leader and Mr
96," Speaker, healthcare should not be a partisan issue --Republican states like Kentucky, Nebraska, and Idaho have expanded Medicaid, and so have Democratic states like Washington, California, andMinnesota"
97," We should be able to get it done here, too"
98,The people of Wisconsin voted for a change this November and asked us to stop playing politics with their health care
99, That’s why I’m announcingtonight that I have fulﬁlled a promise I made to the people of Wisconsin by directing Attorney General Kaul to withdraw from a lawsuit that would gutcoverage for the 2
100,4 million Wisconsinites who have pre-existing conditions
101, I’ve said all along that I believe the best way to maintain protections forhealthcare here in Wisconsin is to stop trying to dismantle those protections at the federal level
102,"In addition, we’re also going to address Wisconsin’s transportation funding crisis"
103,I appointed Secretary-designee Craig Thompson because I know that he will work on both sides of the aisle for a solution that works for Wisconsin
104, Ifully expect that he will be approved with consent of the Senate
105,"I’ve said all along that I believe we have to bring people together to work on this issue, and I believe Secretary-designee Thompson can get it done"
106,"In the coming days, we’ll be announcing a task force of stakeholders to get to work on proposing a bipartisan policy solution to be included in ThePeople’s Budget"
107," The task force will solicit feedback from key partners from all regions of the state, all sectors of the economy, and users of alldiﬀerent modes of transportation"
108,"And while I know that caucus members in both houses support diﬀerent approaches to solving our transportation funding crisis, it’s going to takesacriﬁces and compromises to ﬁnd a long-term, comprehensive solution that works for everyone"
109,But roads and bridges are only a small part of the infrastructure challenges facing our state
110, That’s why I’m also declaring 2019 is the Year of CleanDrinking Water in Wisconsin
111,"According to the Department of Health Services, 1"
112,"7 million Wisconsinites depend on private wells for water, and 47% of these wells do not meetacceptable health standards"
113," Meanwhile, according to the U"
114,S
115," Environmental Protection Agency, we have an estimated 176,000 lead service linesacross our state"
116, Removing lead service lines could cost over $2 billion
117," But Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that for every $1 we spend on replacinglead drinking water lines, we will see a 133% return on our investment in higher lifetime earnings and better health outcomes"
118,"That’s why, in the coming weeks, I’ll be signing an executive order to designate a person at the Department of Health Services to take charge onaddressing Wisconsin’s lead crisis and to help secure federal funding for prevention and treatment programs"
119,"Finally, we’re going to cut taxes by ten percent for everyone making up to $100,000 and families making up to $150,000"
120, But we’re not going to do itby spending money we don’t have or that might not be there in two years
121," I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I’m not going to propose thingsthat we can’t pay for"
122," So instead, we’re going to fund tax relief for hard-working families by capping a corporate tax credit, 80% of which goes toﬁlers making more than $1 million a year"
123,"An economy that works for all of us, healthier communities, more money for our kids and our schools, better roads and infrastructure -- that is whatthe people of Wisconsin expect from us, and that is what the people of Wisconsin deserve"
124,"Given the challenges we face, I expect the Legislature will focus on these important priorities instead of being distracted by division and preventingus from working together to get things done"
125,"You know, in the Governor’s conference room inscribed on the ceiling is a phrase that reads, “The will of the people is the law of the land"
126,”The will of the people is the law of the land
127,That means I expect legislation arriving on my desk will be passed with broad support and in the spirit of bipartisanship
128,"That means instead of taking up an entirely new budget of its own, I expect the Legislature to take up the budget I crafted by and with the people ofour state"
129,I’ll tell you today as I told you a few weeks ago that I have never been more hopeful about our state and our kids’ future
130, I have no doubt that therewill be issues on which we disagree
131, I have no doubt that there will be times when we will be frustrated by the deliberative process of democracy
132,But we will engage civilly
133," We will have discourse and dialogue, but it will not devolve into disrespect"
134, And we will govern with a humble appreciationthat the will of the people -- our people -- is the law of the land
135,"Now, let’s get back to work"
136," Thank you, and On, Wisconsin!Republican Response from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester)As provided to Action 2 NewsHello,I’m Assembly Speaker Robin Vos"

143," Throughout Wisconsin, many farmers had their ﬁrst growing season of HEMP in more than 70 years"
144,Business owners across the state are increasing pay to meet the demand in our competitive market place
145, Wisconsin now has more jobs thanpeople to ﬁll them
146, It’s clear: the state of our state is strong
147, News Weather Sports Health Small TownsYou simply can’t ignore the facts
148, The Wisconsin unemployment rate is at its 11th straight month at or below 3 percent
149, New businesses are upnearly 7 percent
150, We’re seeing the fewest mortgage foreclosures in 18 years
151, Exports have increased by 3
152,2 percent
153, Tourism spending now tops 20billion dollars
154, And Wisconsin families have the lowest tax burden in nearly 50 years
155, Economists agree that the state economy is the best indecades
156,"You might ask, how did we get here? For the last eight years, Republicans worked hard to make Wisconsin open for business"
157, We cut taxes by morethan $8 billion
158,"We made investments in worker training, froze college tuition and made the largest investment ever in K-12 education in actual dollars"
159, Wisconsin ison a roll and Republicans will not allow it to slip backwards
160," We’re committed to keeping your taxes low, the state pension fully funded and ourbudget balanced"
161," We can increase our investment of K-12 education to two-thirds funding, without raising income or sales taxes"
162,"As President Ronald Reagan once said, “As government expands, liberty contracts"
163,"” He also said, “Freedom is never more than one generationaway from extinction"
164,” Republicans in the legislature won’t forget Ronald Reagan’s sentiments
165, We won’t let government grow out of control and wewon’t let socialism to take root in our state
166,"I promise you: Republicans will ﬁght for and protect your freedom, from unnecessary red ﬂag gun laws to the expansion of government-run andcontrolled health care"
167," We will keep spending in check, continue our successful school choice programs and most importantly, protect the unborn"
168,"However, we know that when voters chose divided government, they didn’t choose inaction"
169," In November, the voters said they want us to ﬁnd waysto work together"
170," That’s why only days after the inauguration, Assembly Republicans sent Governor Evers a letter outlining areas where we thoughtwe could ﬁnd agreement"
171," It’s my hope that we focus on issues that don’t divide our state, instead we focus on issues that are easy to ﬁnd commonground"
172, The 11 ideas that we proposed in the letter aren’t meant to be an exhaustive list but a starting point
173," Things like enhancing internet access,preventing homelessness, improving foster care, and cutting middle class taxes should all be slam dunks"
174, Wisconsinites want us to work togetherand these are shared priorities that we can begin working on
175,"This past week, Assembly Republicans moved forward on a middle class tax cut using the governor’s framework"
176," Unlike Governor Evers’ originalproposal, our plan doesn’t raise taxes on farmers or manufacturers"
177, It uses the GOP surplus to pay for it
178," The tax cut is targeted to families makingunder $150,000 and individuals making under $100,000"
179, It saves a married couple with a median income more than $300 annually
180, We can make thismiddle class tax cut a reality
181,Another shared priority is protecting the insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions
182, Assembly Republicans promised that it would be the ﬁrst billwe pass this session; and we did just that earlier today on a bipartisan vote of 76 in favor and 19 against
183, The Assembly approved this billguaranteeing access to insurance for individuals with pre-existing conditions regardless of what happens to ObamaCare
184,The bill also eliminates any annual or lifetime cap on health insurance in Wisconsin
185, There should be no reason why Governor Evers doesn’t sign thepre-existing conditions bill passed with a strong bipartisan majority or approve a middle class tax cut that he proposed and paid for by the GOPsurplus
186,Tonight Governor Evers said he expects the legislature to take up the budget that he crafts quote “by and with the people of our state”
187," We willconsider the ideas in his budget but unfortunately, his ideas are only focusing on one side of the aisle and not the vast majority of Wisconsin"
188," If hisbudget is merely a tax-and-spend wish list, one that would never pass this legislature, his budget would amount to political gamesmanship and thewords of bipartisanship he said tonight will ring hollow"
189, Every person who runs for public oﬃce wants to change their part of their world for thebetter
190,One of my ﬁrst introductions into politics was by my sixth grade teacher in Burlington
191, She told me everyone in the United States has a chance tomake a diﬀerence
192," In our system, good people run for oﬃce because they want to do things and better the lives of their family, friends andneighbors"
193,Democrats want that
194, Republicans want that
195, Every Wisconsinite wants that
196,That’s why I’m so worried that hate and vitriol have become far too pervasive on social media these days
197, I believe it discourages people fromentering the public arena and ﬁghting for their ideas
198, We all want what’s best for Wisconsin: so let’s do a better job listening to one another andunderstanding each other’s perspective
199,"In closing, let me reiterate tonight what Republicans are going to work for over the next two years"
200, We will work to keep the tax burden lower andaﬀordable for the middle class
201, We will protect those with pre-existing conditions
202, We will make record investments in K-12 education
203, And we willmove Wisconsin forward
204,Thank you for joining me
205,God Bless you and your family and God Bless the state of Wisconsin

144,  Last spring I established the Governor’s Childcare Task Force and charged the group withdeveloping a comprehensive strategy to address this issue
145," I’m happy to report that we’vealready made progress in implementing many of their recommendations, includingrelieving childcare providers of onerous regulations"
146," There’s more to do, and I look forward to working with the legislature this session"
147,Because no one should be forced to choose between earning a living and caring for theirchild
148," There are many reasons for the worker shortage, but we need to recognize that, in somecases, it’s because the government has taken away the need or desire to work"

154," But it’s a growing problem, and it’s not just aneconomic one"
155, There is dignity in work; it gives us meaning and purpose
156," So when it’s degraded, whenidleness is rewarded with enhanced unemployment and stimulus checks, when workbegins to seem optional rather than fundamental, then society begins to decay"
157,I’m worried that we’re reaching that point
158, Where workers who stay home are being putahead of the workers who show up

169," Let’s show him that in this State, we appreciate thevalue of work and will promote it at every turn"
170, We start by revamping our unemployment system so that it becomes a re-employmentsystem
171," Unemployment benefits serve an important purpose as a short-term safety net for Iowanswho are unexpectedly out of work, through no fault of their own"
172," But we can’t forget theseare taxpayer funds, and we have to recognize that we’re living in a time of prolonged lowunemployment"
173,"Today, there are many more job openings than Iowans on unemployment"
174,Those Iowans have six months to collect unemployment benefits while they look for one ofthe many open jobs
175," Frankly, that’s more time than necessary"

204," And within a few shortyears, they can go on to become an OB tech, RN or BSN—all while being paid"
205," This innovative approach, and the public-private partnerships that make it possible, arewhat Iowa’s education and healthcare systems need"
206, That’s why we’re launching a newhealthcare registered apprenticeship program that will provide funding to at least fivecommunities to scale what Pella has done

274,"About 70% (over $5,300) of those funds will go directly into an account for families tocustomize their child’s education"

5,"   After two years of challenges, of limited gatherings, it is my high honor to stand before you once again this evening to deliver my fourth State of the State Address"
6,   To report on our shared successes
7,   And to present a blueprint for the final year of my first term
8,"   Joining me tonight in the east gallery is the third “First Gentleman” in Kansas history, my husband, Ted Daughety"
9,   Ted has retired from practicing medicine
10,   But he returned during the pandemic to support our state's many dedicated healthcare professionals as they toiled to keep Kansans safe and healthy
11,   I'd also like to welcome my daughter Kathleen Daughety and my son-in-law Mathias Weiden
12," And I welcome, virtually, my other daughter Molly Daughety, who is watching online"
13,   I also welcome and thank my Cabinet Secretaries who are seated behind me in the west gallery
14,"   The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenges for every agency - and I could not have asked for a better, more prepared team"
15,"   They have not only faced those challenges head on, but each of them has steered their agency to be more fiscally responsible, more nimble, more efficient and more responsive than ever before"
16,"   Page 1 of 21  And finally, it is my pleasure to welcome Lt"
17," Governor David Toland and Second Lady Beth Toland, to their first State of the State in their new capacities"
18,   David took the reins as Lt
19, Governor last January after I appointed our former Lt
20," Governor, Lynn Rogers, to serve as our State Treasurer"
21,"   Lynn is a compassionate, hard-working, and dedicated public servant ---- and he has been a fantastic Treasurer"
22, Lynn has already returned more than $5 million dollars of unclaimed property to the rightful owners
23,"   Thank you, Lynn, for your leadership and your continued service"
24,"   For the past three years, Lieutenant Governor Toland has worked tirelessly as the Secretary of the Department of Commerce"
25,   He has spearheaded efforts to help small businesses weather the pandemic
26, He has rebuilt Commerce programs to - once again - make Kansas nationally and globally competitive
27,"    I'm fortunate to have him by my side, as we continue to put his economic development expertise to good use for Kansans and Kansas communities"
28,"    Thank you, Lieutenant Governor"
29,  It's not just the Lt
30, Governor and my Executive Cabinet who have gone above and beyond during the pandemic
31,   All of you seated here are serving during a uniquely challenging moment in our state’s history
32,"   And the work you're putting in, the collaboration, is helping Kansas turn the corner, paving the way for a more prosperous future for all who choose to call this place home"
33,"  Needless to say, it has been an arduous couple of years for Kansas and the nation"
34,"   We've lost loved ones, coworkers, friends, and neighbors"
35,"    Unfortunately, we continue to lose too many Kansans to this virus"
36,"   But we also saw, and we continue to see, the very best of Kansas rise up in every corner of our state"
37," Page 2 of 21    Our health care professionals have persevered, working long, hard hours, for weeks, then months, now years, to save lives"
38, They continue to be our heroes
39,"   Here with us tonight is one of our heroes: Whitney Freel, a charge nurse on the medical intensive care unit at Stormont Vail Hospital right here in Topeka"
40,"   Whitney, could you please stand for a moment"
41,"   Whitney and her fellow front-line workers have risked their own lives for nearly two years, working around the clock to keep Kansans safe"
42,"    Please know how grateful I am, how grateful Kansas is, for your dedicated service"

44,   The Kansas spirit of neighbor-helping-neighbor has never been stronger
45,   The people of Kansas are getting back on their feet
46, The state of Kansas is getting back on track
47,"   However, right now, and likely for the next few months, the threat of COVID-19 remains, particularly for the unvaccinated and the immuno-compromised"
48,"   While the long-term outlook is much more positive with the new Omicron variant, our hospitals and nursing homes have sounded the alarm"
49,  Rising case numbers from the winter holidays and Omicron have created the toughest surge the medical community has faced since the pandemic began in 2020
50,"   Last week, I issued two new executive orders that create staffing flexibility to keep residents, patients, and staff safe"
51,    It will be imperative that we work together to quickly extend my orders through legislation to help our nursing homes and our hospitals
52,"    For those of you watching at home, I ask that all of you think of your family, your friends, and our front-line health care workers"
53,"    Page 3 of 21  Help each other by getting vaccinated, getting your children vaccinated, and getting the third shot"

55,  We owe it to each other
56,"  Folks, we are going to get through this"
57,"   Since we began the fight against this pandemic, we've taken a clear-eyed, balanced approach - acting responsibly to stop the spread of the virus, while also ensuring that our Kansas economy grows and stays strong"
58,"   And because we managed our budget responsibly and saw record economic growth and investment in our state, I'm now proud to say we have the largest budget surplus in the past 40 years"
59,  That's the largest surplus in 40 years all while balancing the budget and fully funding our schools
60,"   Whereas, just a few years ago, Kansas was making headlines for its budget mis-management - I believe Kansas is now the most fiscally responsible state in the nation"
61,   We've paid down state debts
62,"   And we're adding $600 million dollars to the state's Rainy Day fund, the most money that's ever been put in there"
63,    Growing the Rainy Day Fund is the responsible thing to do
64,   To make sure critical services like schools and law enforcement are always funded even if our economy takes a turn for the worse
65,"   Because we've managed the budget so responsibly, I was proud to announce that every working Kansan who filed taxes in 2021 will get a $250 dollar rebate this year - $500 dollars for married couples filing jointly"
66,"    That's money back in your pocket to pay for child care, to take your family on a mini-vacation, or to buy groceries"
67,   Page 4 of 21  While we’re on the topic of groceries…
68,   Here's something we all know: Food in Kansas costs families way too much
69,"   And even as we sit here with a record surplus, Kansans continue to pay higher taxes on groceries than anyone in the country"
70,   It makes no sense
71,"   For years, many of us, on both sides of the aisle, have been calling for an end to the state's sales tax on food"
72,"   Now, with this surplus in the bank and increased revenue because of our economic growth, we can finally, responsibly, afford to totally eliminate the grocery sales tax"
73,"   I've called on the legislature to send a bill to my desk to end this tax, once and for all"
74,"   It will save Kansas families hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars a year"
75,   This is a commonsense policy on which Democrats and Republicans can completely agree
76,   The only obstacle that could block this legislation is the same type of toxic political games that have poisoned Washington D
77,C
78, …
79, where denying a political opponent a win has become more important than getting things done for the people they represent
80,   We are better than that in Kansas
81,   Let's not overcomplicate this
82,"   The essence of the bill can be summed up in 13 words:   We hereby eliminate the state sales tax on food in Kansas, effective immediately"
83,   Just 13 words
84,"   Send me a clean, bi-partisan bill, that eliminates the state sales tax on food by Kansas Day, January 29th"
85,   I'll sign it the moment it hits my desk
86,   Page 5 of 21  We must not delay
87," Every day we delay costs Kansas families money, each and every day"
88,    It will be a win for every one of you in this room
89," And, much more importantly, a win for working Kansans"
90,"  And, we know working families need a break, particularly, after the last two years"
91,"   This pandemic has created so many strains, so many stressors, and so many challenges, we simply cannot let it derail the careers or the dreams of our young people"
92,   That’s why we have remained laser-focused - to protect their futures
93,    That meant upholding my promise to bring fiscal sanity back to our state government
94,"    It wasn’t easy, and not a day has gone by that I haven’t been tasked with making tough financial decisions"
95,    But our resolve to keep the state checkbook balanced is paying off in a big way
96,    Today I'm announcing that my budget includes a total freeze on college tuition increases
97,   You heard that right
98, No tuition increases whatsoever
99,    This virus took something from our students
100," And, we are going to give them something back"
101,"    Again, it’s a huge win for our young people and for all working Kansans"
102,    These are the types of things we can do when our state's economy is growing the way it is
103,   And it is economic growth we should all be proud of
104,"   Look at where we are…     We've created more than 30,000 new jobs"
105," That's 30,000 - even during a pandemic"
106,   Our unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for over a year
107,"   And in 2021 alone, the private sector invested nearly $3"
108,8 billion dollars in new facilities and equipment
109, Page 6 of 21    That's a new state record
110, By a long shot
111,   That means: new businesses coming to our state
112,   Existing businesses expanding
113,   Big companies opening new divisions
114,   Small businesses hiring new employees
115,   It means jobs for Kansans living in our cities
116,   And in our suburbs
117, And in our rural communities
118,   Our small businesses are growing
119,"   Our big companies are hiring hundreds of new employees and expanding, like Hilmar Cheese in Dodge City, Superior Boiler in Hutchinson and the Schwan's Pizza Plant in Salina"
120,"   And big national companies, like Urban Outfitters, are choosing to build distribution centers here - because we have a strong economy and the best workforce in the nation"
121,"   Listen to this…   Over the past three years, we have secured a total of more than $7"
122,6 billion dollars in new business investments in Kansas
123,   That's more than any previous administration's total in the entirety of their first term - and we still have another year left
124,"   Remember several years back, Kansas was in the national news for all the wrong reasons"
125,"   Well, in 2019, we were back in the national news - but this time as CNBC's Comeback State of the Year"
126,"   And in 2021, Kansas was recognized with the prestigious Gold Shovel Award - a national award given to Governors who lead the way in attracting job-creating investments to their states"
127, Page 7 of 21    There's more economic opportunity in the state of Kansas today than at any time in our history
128,"  And Kansans should really take pride in the role they have played in helping our state and, all of the nation, successfully navigate through this pandemic"
129,    Everyone here knows this: Kansas processes 25% of the nation's highest quality beef
130,"    If our meatpacking plants had shut down during the pandemic, it would’ve created a food crisis for our entire country"
131,   We really couldn't let that happen
132,"   So, during those first days and weeks of the pandemic, I partnered with then-Senator, Pat Roberts, who was chair of the senate ag committee"
133," Together, Senator Roberts and I worked with President Trump to make sure our meat-packing plants stayed open, safely"
134,"    It wasn't about political party, it was about keeping Kansans who feed our nation, and the world, on the job"
135,"   As a result, Kansas was the only state in the nation to keep our major meatpacking plants open during the entirety of the pandemic"
136,"   I'd like to thank our federal delegation, particularly Representative Sharice Davids and former Senator Pat Roberts, for their hard work in making that happen"
137,"  After all, we know that the agriculture industry is the lifeblood of our economy"
138, And farmers are truly the heartbeat of our state
139,"   Right now, our hearts go out to the Kansas farmers and ranchers who have lost their livestock, their crops, and even, in some cases, their own homes to wildfires"
140,"   I want you to know we're doing everything in our power to provide relief to restore your livestock, and rebuild your farms, your ranches, and your lives"
141,  With us here tonight is Russell County Emergency Manager Keith Haberer
142,"  Keith, could you please stand for a moment"
143,   Page 8 of 21  Keith has been a firefighter and an emergency manager in Russell for more than 20 years
144,"   During the recent wildfires, I witnessed how hard Keith worked to help the people in his community stay safe"
145,   For weeks he’s been working nonstop
146," He coordinated the county’s response to the raging fires and delivered resources to the families, farmers and ranchers who were impacted by the devastation"
147,"   He is one of the thousands of first responders all across the state: our firefighters, our law enforcement, our national guard, and our EMTs, who step up when a crisis hits"
148,"   Thank you Keith, for your service to your neighbors and to your community"
149,"   Our farming and ranching families are lucky to have men and women like Keith, who stand ready to provide support when times are tough"
150,    This administration is equally committed to supporting our agriculture industry
151,"     Whether it is through:   Being the only Democratic Governor in the country to support the USMCA trade agreement;   Responding to COVID-related challenges;    Or adding Short Line rail projects to move product to market more cost effectively, more efficiently"
152,"  But still, we know that farming isn't getting any easier – particularly with the natural disasters and global supply chain challenges"
153,"    But we also know, our farmers and ranchers are the most resilient people on earth"
154,"   As I travel across Kansas, the stories I hear are so inspiring"
155,"   Farmers like Vance and Louise Ehmke, owners of Ehmke Seed in Lane County"
156,"   They took over the family farm in the mid '70s, as the fourth generation of Ehmkes to operate it"
157," Page 9 of 21    Now Louise is a Democrat from California, and Vance is a Republican from right here in Kansas"
158, The two met while students at Bethany College in Lindsborg
159,"   Recently, the Ehmkes celebrated 50 years of a happy, bi-partisan, marriage"
160,    And they’re with us tonight
161," I’d like to have Louise and Vance, representing all Kansas farmers and ranchers, please stand to be recognized"
162,"   You know, Louise and Vance are still out there each morning with their fellow farmers and ranchers, rain or shine, snow or sleet"
163,"    That toughness, that grit, that sense of pride, so often passed from one generation to the next …"
164, that's what makes Kansas farmers so special
165,"  Now, looking ahead, I’m excited to share with you that my budget this year also restores full funding to the State Water Plan for the first time in 15 years"
166,"  The water plan is a five-year blueprint for action that will ensure that we have a reliable, quality water supply to support not only the needs of Kansas communities, but a thriving farming economy"
167,"   Because everyone in this room knows, as I do, that agriculture built the Kansas economy, and it will always be the backbone of our state"
168,"    And, despite all of the obstacles that our farmers and ranchers have faced, and thanks to their unrivaled persistence, Kansas is on its way to another record year of agricultural exports"
169,"   In fact, we’ll surpass the $4 billion-dollar mark in exports for the second consecutive year"
170,   A feat not accomplished in nearly a decade
171,   Four billion dollars
172, That's a big deal
173,  Growing our rural economy has been a major focus of my Administration
174,   Our efforts to rebuild our rural economy began day one when we established the Office of Rural Prosperity
175,    Page 10 of 21  We then moved expeditiously to re-start the Kansas Mainstreet program - to help our rural communities keep their downtowns vibrant
176,"   We cherish our Main Streets - as the heart of our communities, the cultural centers of our communities, and as their economic engines"
177,"     And, if we've learned anything these past couple of years about doing business in this day and age, it's that if you don't have access to high-speed Internet – you are going to get left behind"
178,"   When I got into office, Kansas was way behind the eight ball on broadband development"
179,"   The state had no roadmap, no funding, and no plan"
180,"    So, we established the Office of Broadband Development, and now, we have expanded internet access to over 50,000 new households and businesses"
181, We’ve connected rural communities that were frustrated for years by the lack of access
182,"   During the pandemic, hotspots were strategically deployed to ensure that our students in low-income households could continue their education remotely"
183,"    We won't stop until every Kansan who wants, or needs, high-speed Internet has access to it"
184,"   For as much as rural Kansas - all of Kansas for that matter - needs a strong information superhighway, they also need better actual highways"
185,"   The type you drive on to get your product to market, to get to work, or get your kids to school"
186,"    Sadly, for the past 10 years, politicians have taken money that was supposed to go for roads and bridges and instead used it to clean up the mess created by the tax experiment"
187,    The highway fund became known as: “the Bank of K-DOT
188,"”   Well, it's not a bank"
189, It's been a slush fund
190,"   And this year the slush fund goes away, and the “bank” closes for good"
191,  We'll make sure that money meant for roads and bridges is actually used for roads and bridges
192," Page 11 of 21    We have already completed numerous projects across Kansas, and many others are in the pipeline"
193,   They are important projects like:     The widening of U
194,S
195, 69 from a two-lane to a four-lane expressway in Crawford and Bourbon Counties
196,"   This project completes the much-needed, long-overdue, 4-lane highway from Kansas City to Pittsburg"
197," A promise made years ago, and, now, finally kept"
198,"    Late last year, we announced design modifications in Johnson County for K-10 that will improve a stretch of highway serving 65,000 drivers per day"
199,"   In Wichita - the state has partnered, for several years with the city, the County, and the federal government to finish the $86 million North Junction project"
200,"   When completed, it will, finally, alleviate Wichita's worst bottleneck"
201, Every member of the Sedgwick County delegation sitting here tonight knows exactly what I’m talking about
202,   Now new road projects like North Junction don't always create splashy headlines
203,   But they do make communities safer
204,   They do create jobs
205,   They do stimulate economic activity
206,"   And, they change the very quality of life for residents who rely on these roads every day"
207,"   While we’re on the subject of improving quality of life for the people of Kansas, we cannot forget about our health care systems and our hospitals"
208,"   For years, we've debated Medicaid expansion…"
209,
210, round and round
211,"   Folks, medicaid expansion is the quickest, the easiest, and the most common sense way to help Kansans"
212,"   And we’re not just talking about 150,000 Kansans accessing quality, affordable health care"
213," Page 12 of 21    The fact is, communities can’t grow or survive if their hospitals close"
214,   Kansas has lost five hospitals in recent years
215,   We can’t afford to lose another
216,   We owe it to our rural families and businesses
217,"   Medicaid expansion won’t just protect small towns and their residents, it will keep health care professionals from moving to neighboring states - most of which are Red states - all of which have expanded Medicaid"
218,"   Right now, we’re the stubborn, self-defeating, state in the middle of all of them, we are sabotaging our rural communities and their efforts to recruit new jobs and residents"
219, We are shooting ourselves in the foot
220,   Medicaid expansion is something we can do right now
221,   It is well past time
222, Let’s get this done
223,  A strong health care system will always be a hallmark of a healthy state and a healthy economy
224,"   Just as important, however, is the strength of our public education system"
225,"   Four years ago, when I ran for office, I ran to be the Education Governor"
226,"    After years of budget cuts and neglect, Kansas needed one"
227,"   And, now, I am proud to say, that for the Fourth straight year: we are fully funding our public schools"
228,"  And, we are doing it with a balanced budget"
229,    Because it's not an either-or
230,"    We can balance the budget while also funding our schools, fixing our roads and bridges, funding other essential services, investing in economic development"
231,    Page 13 of 21  The full funding of our schools is something everyone in this Chamber can celebrate
232,"   But, I also know that, for these past couple of years, during the pandemic, the challenges facing our schools have gone way beyond just funding"
233,"   Last year, in my State of the State, I spoke directly to teachers - who - nearly overnight - reinvented the way they taught, doing whatever it took to educate our children during the pandemic's worst days"
234,"   We’ve worked hard to get everyone back in the classroom, but the job of a teacher hasn't gotten any easier"
235," If anything, it’s more difficult and more stressful"
236,"   Teachers have always deserved our deepest gratitude, our respect, and our support"
237,"   To all the Kansas teachers out there, we thank you"
238, We applaud you
239,"   This year, I'd also like to take a moment to speak directly to Kansas parents"
240, Especially those with school-aged children
241,   You have been through a lot these past couple of years
242, A whole lot
243,"   Now I have two daughters, both well out of the house - thank goodness - but I often think about what it would have been like if they were still young and had been at home during the pandemic"
244,    I know it would have been incredibly hard to balance their education and my job
245,"   It would have been hard dealing with their losses not being able to hang out with their friends, not going to birthday parties, not participating in graduation ceremonies"
246,"  And with this virus, particularly because it has gone on for so long, sometimes, you feel like there's no right answer"
247,"   When all you really want is to do right by your children, to have a voice, to have a say, in the decisions that impact their lives"
248,   I want you to know that I’ve heard you
249," I have approached decisions I’ve made not only as a Governor, but also as a parent"
250,"  Page 14 of 21  I know, with all the ways this virus has changed and keeps changing our lives it can be difficult to keep up"
251,   This has been unchartered territory
252,   This pandemic has deprived our kids of a normal childhood for far too long
253,"   That’s why our Department of Wildlife and Parks, together with our Tourism Division, partnered with the State Department of Education to launch the Kansas Sunflower Summer program"
254,"  This program provided kids and their families the opportunity to visit all of our state’s first-class attractions: our museums, our parks, our zoos:free of charge"
255,"    In total, more than 70,000 Kansans participated in the program"
256," Sunflower Summer was so successful that we have every intention, to not only do it again next summer – but also to expand it"
257,"     Our schools are now open and they will stay open, but the Sunflower Summer program helped make this uneasy time a little more manageable, a little more affordable, and a little more normal"
258,"  Back in the classrooms, we also know our kids are feeling the lingering effects of the pandemic"
259,   Not every parent has the means to help their children get the attention or the tools they need to fill the learning gaps created by the pandemic
260,"   Just yesterday, we announced a bipartisan agreement to allocate $50 million dollars in Learning Recovery Grants for students who need that extra help to get caught up"
261,"  These grants will give parents the ability to sign their kids up for counseling, tutoring, summer camps, whatever their child needs to close the learning gap"
262,"   We can’t turn back the clock on the last two years, but we can lay out the path to support parents and put students in the best position to find success"
263,   Another thing on the minds of parents these days is not having to worry about their child’s safety
264,    Page 15 of 21  I know I’m speaking for parents when I say that the world is a whole lot bigger and much more complicated than when we were growing up
265,"   We sense it as leaders as well, and I’ve made protecting children and keeping them safe a top priority as Governor"
266,    That starts by supporting our law enforcement officers
267,  My budget contains historic levels of funding for law enforcement
268,"  Funding that will provide better equipment, better training facilities, and greater public safety"
269,  And for our state highway patrol - a much deserved pay-increase
270,"  We're also increasing funding for evidence-based juvenile delinquency programs, so we can reach these kids before it's too late and keep them out of the system"
271,"     There’s no question that as the world has changed, it has become harder to be a kid"
272,"   From social media pressures, to life during a pandemic, growing up in 2022 is a lot more complicated, and difficult"
273,"    Imagine, dealing with all that they have to deal with - and what’s happened over the last 2 years - while also being a child in foster care"
274,"   When I took office, our foster care system was a mess"
275,"    It was an embarrassment, it was immoral and it did not reflect how Kansans value and cherish their children"
276,     It wasn’t going to be easy
277,"   But I knew if we were going to create real accountability, that we would have to pull the curtain back and do a full, honest assessment of our foster care system and make the necessary and critical changes, to protect our kids"
278,"  And after three years, we have made significant progress"
279,   Page 16 of 21  We have decreased the number of children in foster care by over 15 percent
280, That’s one thousand fewer kids in the system
281,    That progress started with the tireless work done by Secretary Laura Howard and her team at the Department for Children and Families
282,"    They studied the mistakes of the past and they took an intentional approach, to move the state away from a child welfare system and toward a child and family well-being system"
283,"    Secretary Howard directed the agency to focus on things like kinship care, where a child is placed with a family member or a very close family friend, instead of being placed in the system"
284,    Kansas was also one of the first states in the nation to implement the Family First Prevention Services Act
285,"    This program provides support services for struggling parents to increase their ability to care for their own children, in their own home, rather than in the foster care system"
286,"    Just last year, I signed an executive order creating the Division of Child Advocate"
287,    The Child Advocate will ensure that the progress we have made is not fleeting or subject to political manipulation
288,"    The advocate will ensure an independent, accountable system to investigate complaints, to help families navigate a very complex system, and act as a data-resource for further improvement of the system"
289,"   Most importantly, the child advocate will make sure kids in our care are healthier and safer"
290,   The Division of Child Advocate has been a deeply bipartisan effort and would not have been possible without the support and input of legislators and stakeholders on both sides of the aisle
291,"   I know some of you here have spent years working to get this issue over the finish line, and I'm grateful for your efforts"
292,"   Likewise, an area where we should be able to find common ground is our state's mental health system"
293,"   Page 17 of 21  Whether we talk about children or their parents, veterans or farmers, small business owners or health care workers, this pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges for so many Kansans"
294,"   That's why I've included additional funding in my budget, to make it easier for local communities to provide critical mental health services closer to home, and reduce the strain on our law enforcement agencies, our jails and our hospital emergency rooms"
295,   It will save lives and it will protect our communities
296,"   I know many of you care deeply about this issue, and I look forward to working with you to create a mental health system in Kansas that is second to none"
297,"   Speaking about second to none, as you all know, just last month, we lost our proudest native son, Bob Dole"
298,   Senator Dole was a passionate voice for Kansas
299," He was also a passionate voice for an entire generation, the greatest generation"
300,"   In fact, it's because of people like Bob Dole that the greatest generation got its name"
301,"   Senator Dole once told us: “In politics, honorable compromise is no sin"
302, It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance
303,"”   Senator Dole also said: “When it's all over, it's not about who you were, it's about whether you made a difference"
304,”   These are words we should all keep close to our hearts
305,   Whether you made a difference
306,"   Now, if you only looked at social media, you'd think nothing gets done around here, at all … just a bunch of bickering"
307,   But the truth is - that's not the case
308,"   Thanks to the good work of the people in this Chamber, I have signed 187 bipartisan bills"
309,    Let’s look at the list:   Page 18 of 21  •  •  •  •  •  • A bi-partisan bill to fully fund our public schools
310," A bi-partisan transportation plan, which will lead to 130 new infrastructure projects"
311," A bi-partisan scholarship program for our students in high-demand, high-skilled fields"
312, A bi-partisan bill that extends the tax credit program that helps Kansas start-ups succeed
313, A bi-partisan bill to support our military families and encourage them to stay in Kansas
314,  A bi-partisan emergency loan program to help families and businesses pay their utility bills when they skyrocketed last February
315,   The list goes on and on
316,"   When we think back several years, and reflect on why things in Kansas went so far in the wrong direction, it’s because we weren’t prioritizing what Kansans want and what they need"
317,"    Kansans want their government to focus on the day-to-day needs that most of us can agree on - and not on the ideological issues, or the culture wars, that divide us"
318,   That means they want:   New businesses that bring good jobs
319,   Strong public schools
320,   Roads that don't wreck their cars
321,   Safe communities
322,   Access to basic health care
323,   A balanced budget
324,"   Page 19 of 21  And when possible, and when responsible, tax relief to help working families"
325,"   When I talk to Kansans from all political parties in all corners of the state, the most common theme I hear is: “I am so sick and tired of all the political fighting"
326,"”   And usually, they're not talking about the people in this building"
327,   They're talking about in their own lives
328,   And the feeling that politics now dominates everything
329,   The friendships that are being torn apart
330,   Social media feeds you're afraid to look at anymore
331,   Family members you can barely talk to
332,    Politics rearing its ugly head in our children's schools
333,"   I'm sure all of you in this room can think of people in your lives who, just a few years ago, you could have a civil conversation and talk about the issues of the day - and now, you really can't"
334,   It's all become so toxic
335,   Now the people in this Chamber didn't cause this problem
336, Much bigger forces are at play
337,   But the people in this Chamber can be part of the solution
338,   We can turn down the temperature
339,   We can be civil and compromise
340,   We can be role models for our children
341,    We can put allegiance to Kansans ahead of allegiance to political party
342,   We can be as good and as decent as the people who sent us here
343,"  Now, some of you may know that I am a baseball fan"
344,"  Page 20 of 21    And one of the great joys of my life was spending a day, 20-some years ago, with the great Buck O'Neil, at the Negro League Museum"
345,"   Buck was an iconic player for the Kansas City Monarchs, but his larger contributions to baseball and to this country came in his later years, when he lead the campaign to establish the Negro League Museum"
346,"   He did it to make sure we never forget those players, the injustices they faced, and their rightful place in history"
347,"    Buck passed away about fifteen years ago, at the age 94"
348,"   Just a few weeks ago, we learned that Buck was, posthumously, voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame to, finally, be honored alongside the game's very best"
349,"    Long overdue in my opinion, and it's a shame he wasn't alive to see it"
350,"   But Buck was an eternal optimist, even toward the end of a life that had had so many hardships"
351,   One of Buck’s more delightful sayings was:   “Hold hands with the person next to you
352," That way, they can't get away"
353, And neither can you
354,"”   So, let us all hold hands these next few months"
355,   And not let go until we finally get things done
356,   God bless our great and beloved state of Kansas
357,    Thank you and goodnight

0," Governor Doug Burgum 2022 State of the State Address February 16, 2022 Fargo Theatre  Good morning"
1," Good morning, everyone"
2, Thank you for being here in person and thanks for those that are watching online
3, I want to say welcome to everybody
4," First Lady Kathryn, my sons Joe and Tom, my daughter Jesse who is watching online, my sister Barbara and the other Burgums in the family"
5," I think everybody knows, as Brent said, when you're serving in these roles today, whether it's city commission, county commission, state legislator, any elected official the last two years, you're not in this thing alone, you’re in it and your family’s with you"
6," So again, I want to say thanks to my amazing family and a special welcome"
7, Now I've got a son who's engaged
8," So welcome, Simone"
9, Looking forward to the June wedding
10, So way to go
11, Congratulations
12,"  We've had an incredible year of progress in North Dakota, and people that are here been watching and listening"
13," Lots of exciting announcements related to value-added energy, value-added agriculture, economic development"
14," And of course, right at the forefront, pushing tirelessly to get these projects over the finish line has been one person"
15," A lot of people work to make all these happen, but I’ve got to tell you, Lieutenant Governor Brent Sanford, and all these things that are happening and all these announcements, he's at the front, he's behind the scenes, or he's leading the way making it happen"
16, We've got the best Lieutenant Governor in the nation
17, Let's give it up for Brent Sanford
18,"  As we settle into the year 2022, I think everybody here understands that the world today is a complex, changing dynamic and there are conflicts between regions and powers and superpowers and countries all over the world that at any moment may boil over"
19," And here at home, our nation, as we come out of COVID, everything's emotionally charged and politically divided"
20, In D
21,C
22,", we know we've got an administration that's pursuing regulations and policies that actually create headwinds for our two largest industries, energy and agriculture"
23,   And mainstream and social media seem to be at the forefront of everyone's thinking
24, They're competing for all of our attention all the time
25, And these are businesses that are driven by advertising supported models
26," Whether it's social media, mainstream media, they are competing for all of our attention"
27," And the best way to get us to click on something or view something or try to pay attention to something is to convince us what we should be fearing the most, what we should be afraid of, what we should be most shocked about, and that creates a dynamic for the whole country"
28,"  But right here in North Dakota, in the reality, on the ground, it's different from what you may see either nationally or internationally"
29," In North Dakota, examples even this week, where we can   get together quickly and easily and frequently get all the people together in the same room and on the same page and make things happen"
30,   Hardworking North Dakotans know that we're in the business of feeding and fueling the world
31," And as such, we're not in competition with our friend, our neighbor, the person we've never met on Facebook"
32," We're in competition with other states, and our state is in competition with other nations"
33, We're competing for talent and for workforce
34, We're competing to retain our youth and our adults
35, We're competing for the capital investment to help our state reach its fullest potential
36,   To be a North Dakotan in 2022 means that we're living in a land of incredible opportunity
37, Ours is clearly a state that's been blessed with abundant natural resources and some of the richest and most productive soil
38," We cherish our wide open spaces, the beauty of our diverse landscapes, our endless skies and our stunning sunsets"
39," Regardless of the temperature outside, it's always beautiful in North Dakota"
40," We value our God-given freedoms, perhaps like no other state, and we honor those who fight to protect them"
41,"   It's no wonder that in 2021, why North Dakota was ranked in the top five for the best state to live, the best state for families, and the best state for business friendliness"
42," We've also earned top 10 rankings in the best state for millennials, the best state to retire, the best state to start a business, and the best state for taking care of our natural environment with some of the cleanest air and water in the nation"
43," And certainly at the end of the day, what matters, perhaps most, is many sites have agreed that North Dakota is one of the happiest states in the nation"
44, Let's give yourselves a hand for all of that
45,"  Our population in North Dakota grew faster than all but three other states during the decade between 2010 and 2020, and families from near and far are finding incredible opportunities within our borders"
46,"   Among those, one great example, Miguel Delgado and his wife, Jessica Morales, they're from the U"
47,S
48, territory of Puerto Rico
49," And Miguel earned, like many people in North Dakota have done, an animal science degree in 2014"
50," A friend invited him to take a vacation in Mandan, North Dakota"
51, He instantly fell in love with the land and the scenery
52, He found a job at a local cattle ranch and decided with Jessica to move to North Dakota
53,"   After the pandemic hit, one evening they were sitting with friends and they decided that North Dakota needed an authentic, Latin bakery"
54, Miguel felt that he could recreate his family's generational recipes
55," The couple did what entrepreneurs and risk takers do, they invested everything they had to launch El Coqui Bakery in south Bismarck in November 2020 with co-owners Jossef Feiner and Dyna Mena"
56,   Today that business is thriving
57," Miguel, Jessica, Jossef and Dyna are busy running a bakery and they couldn't be here today, but we know they're watching online"
58," So please join me in   welcoming them as some of the more than 100,000 new residents that have decided in the last decade to call North Dakota home"
59, Welcome
60,  The 2020 census also revealed that we're now the fourth-youngest state
61, This is a complete reversal from when we were one of the oldest states
62, We've got a number of students that are here in the room
63," Again, thank you to the Governor's Band and Choir"
64, And we want to give a shout out to them for helping us be one of the youngest states in the nation
65, And so we want to give a shout out to them
66," But as I hear myself saying that, technically, I guess your parents had a hand in that, anyway, but let's give them a hand for helping us do that"
67,"  ***  And we gave you one example of a startup, but businesses are booming in North Dakota"
68," Last year, we registered more than 30,000 new businesses, well, last two years, 30,000 new businesses in the last two years"
69,"   And on the big scale level, in the past year alone, we've seen announcements and transactions totaling more than $7 billion in capital investment in our energy industry, over $2"
70,"2 billion in announcements about projects coming for value-added agriculture, and there's been over $12 billion invested in North Dakota across bio-manufacturing, unmanned aircraft systems, and other technology-based businesses"
71," That is total investment coming into North Dakota, across energy, ag, and new, emerging technology businesses of over $21 billion"
72,   This isn't happening by accident
73," This massive investment, it's accumulation of years and decades of intentional effort by our state leaders to build a stable business tax and regulatory environment and to build a business friendly North Dakota"
74," So all of you that are here, particularly all the elected officials, current and past, you're all part of that"
75, Give yourselves a hand for that incredible work
76,"  Yes, we think of North Dakota as our Field of Dreams, but that Field of Dreams is becoming a reality"
77, We're attracting remarkable levels of investment
78, We're creating tremendous opportunity for today's workforce and for future generations
79,"  Today, the state of our state is strong and it's growing stronger by the day because of our unshakable faith in the unlimited potential of North Dakota and its people"
80,"  ***  Last year we saw again several historic challenges for our state, but North Dakotans showed that as always, we're up to the task"
81,   Regardless of the peaks and valleys of the ongoing global pandemic we know that keeping our schools open for in-person learning is the best for our students
82, And kudos to all of our teachers and administrators for making that happen
83, Let's give those teachers a round of applause
84,    We've encouraged people to visit with their trusted medical providers about vaccines
85," Vaccines, statistically, remain the best defense against COVID"
86, They drastically reduce the need for hospitalization
87," And as evidence of our focus from the beginning of protecting the most vulnerable, our skilled nursing residents and our staff are boosted and vaccinated at rates well above the national average"
88," And at the same time we will, and we will continue to push back when the federal government overreaches into personal liberty and individuals’ personal health decisions, or if they're overreaching into the rights of private business owners"
89," Washington needs to be reminded, the states created the federal government, not the other way around"
90,"  And during the nearly two years of this battle against the invisible enemy, the COVID virus, the pandemic has stretched our health care facilities and their personnel to their limits"
91,"   Our state's nurses, doctors, hospital and clinic staff, long-term care workers, first responders and others, even as we're here today, they continue to save lives through their tireless efforts"
92," Our state agencies and local public health units have supported them with everything from medical supplies, technical assistance, case reporting, offering and supporting with mass testing events, vaccine clinics, and all of this to help reduce the burden on the health care system so the health care system can take care of not just COVID, but all the health needs of the citizens of North Dakota"
93,"   And on the front line of that, of course, is our nurses"
94," And so to honor the incredible efforts by the state's over 22,000 licensed nurses, we're declaring this week Nurses Week in North Dakota"
95, Please join me in sharing our deepest gratitude for the truly lifesaving work of all of our state's nurses and the heroes of this pandemic
96,"  Of course, North Dakotas are not just known for our resiliency"
97, I think it's a source of pride for people that live here
98," And last year, Mother Nature tested us like never before with the worst drought conditions recorded in our state's 133-year history"
99,"   Using our whole-of-government approach we provided over $6 million in water supply and transportation aid to keep livestock herds watered and fed, leaving no stone unturned to help our farmers and ranchers"
100,"  For the first time in recent memory, our state's firefighters fought intense wildfires in every single month of the year, 2021"
101," Believe it or not, just last month, it marked the one anniversary of a massive January prairie fire along the North Dakota-South Dakota border that kicked off what would become the driest winter on record for our state"
102,"  And who could forget last April when windswept flames threatened to engulf our state's top tourist attraction, the city of Medora, and forced the city's evacuation"
103," We rapidly deployed our 'Always Ready, Always There' North Dakota National Guard"
104," They jumped in their helicopters, they flew west with 600-gallon water buckets to stop the fire and save Medora"
105," And they   collaborated, incredible collaboration among local, state, and federal agencies"
106," They not only saved the city, but they also saved the historic Chateau and the Burning Hills Amphitheater"
107,"   This winter, these firefighters are finally getting a well-deserved break after responding last year to an unprecedented 2,199 fires that consumed over 122,000 acres"
108, That's more than triple the annual number of wildfires in the previous five years
109," And we're so honored and pleased to have some of those firefighter leaders that are here with us today, Ryan, Kyle, Jeff, Josh, Lee, Jimmy, and Rod"
110," These heroes along with all of our state's firefighters who worked together all year to protect lives, prevent millions of dollars of property damage across the state, have our deepest appreciation"
111, Let's have those firefighters stand
112, Let's give them a big hand
113, Thank you for everything you've done
114,"  And while smoke and flames make wildfires noticeable by virtually anyone, makes for great photos for the press and the papers"
115," Our state continues daily, to face a far less visible threat"
116, And it is a threat
117," It's largely out of the public eye, but there continues to be a war on our state and our country led in many cases by state-sponsored cyberattacks"
118," When I say state-sponsored, we're talking China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, leading the pack"
119,"   Last year, the state of North Dakota defended against 4"
120,"5 billion, yes, that's billion with a B, 4"
121,5 billion attacks on state government
122," That includes K-12, higher education, and anybody else that's touching our state network"
123, That's more than double the number of attacks from two years ago
124, We have set up automated defense systems that stop most of those attacks
125," But our small set of team members at NDIT still had to handle over 50,000 cyberattack incidents last year"
126,   More must be done to protect our citizens trusted information and our way of life
127," Cyberattacks, ransom attacks, all too common these days"
128, It makes cybersecurity education more important than ever
129," We can and should be, we came close in the special session, we need to get it over the finish line, but we can be the first state in the nation to adopt computer and cyber science graduation standards for everybody in K-12 through college, through graduate school"
130," Our PK-20W initiative, which reflects every student from kindergarten through Ph"
131,D
132,", has already won awards for its statewide approach to computer science and cyber education in workforce training"
133,"  And speaking of awards, last weekend we held the first ever Cyber Madness Tournament in North Dakota"
134, And I want to say congratulations to the team from James Valley Career & Technology Center
135," These are high school students from Jamestown, Montpelier, Gackle-Streeter school districts"
136, They put their test against teams from all over the state
137, They put their skills to work
138, They came out on top
139, They won the competition
140, That team is here today
141," Please help me in congratulating Coach Heinert and team members, Jordan, Collin, Karl, and Mason"
142,   So cool
143, Did you guys have fun at Cyber Madness? Fun to come out on top? That's awesome
144, I love that you got class B and class A schools all working together on the same team
145, Was there anybody from Jamestown or was it all class B kids? One? Okay
146, All right
147, They let one class A kid   in
148," The First Lady's happy, Jamestown was represented"
149, There we go
150, Good job
151, Her home school
152," Anyway, but that's our future"
153," Defending our state, defending our nation"
154, Thank you
155,"  We are also the first state to authorize central, shared service approach to cybersecurity across all aspects of state government"
156," And our state network has 252,000 daily users"
157, We have over 400 entities
158, That gives us a surface area that's equal to a Fortune 50 company
159," Last spring, we signed milestone legislation that helped us defend against cyberattacks"
160," We also invested more than $15 million to enhance the state's cybersecurity software initiatives, and thank you legislature for that, but we're still facing huge risks"
161,  It is our duty as a state government to protect our citizens’ data and their digital livelihoods
162," In the 2023 session, looking ahead to that, we've got to advance additional investments in cybersecurity defenses"
163,"   ***  In November, we worked really closely with the legislature on a super successful special session"
164, It's only the 16th special session in our state's history
165," We passed in five, quick days, historic tax relief"
166," We strategically invested hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding, not in filling budget holes"
167, We invested it in important projects with high return on investment with matching dollars that will help drive our state forward
168, And the legislature completed the legislative redistricting
169,"   Thanks to the legislative leadership and the strong starting point that came out of the work that we did with the legislators, and Brent and I, with the work and all the agencies on the Accelerate ND plan, again, that special session wrapped up in just five days, limiting the cost to taxpayers and probably the most productive five days in the history of the state in a legislative session"
170,"  Now, a lot of credit goes to the legislative leaders"
171, Three of those legislative leaders have since announced that their current term in office will be their last
172," Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner of Dickinson, House Majority Leader Chet Pollert of Carrington, Senate Minority Leader Joan Heckaman of New Rockford"
173," They have all served their constituents and they've served all of North Dakota with dignity, they've served with grace, they've served with compassion, and they've served with courage"
174," Replacing these fine public servants will not be easy and they'll be dearly missed, we'll miss working with them on behalf of our citizens"
175, They're here today
176," Please join me in thanking Senator Heckaman, Representative Pollert, and Senator Wardner for their exceptional service"
177,"  That may be the last time you see Chet's face, because you're just going to see the back of his head on a motorcycle heading out of here"
178, That's what he's got planned
179," So we wish you well, thank you"
180," Thank you, Chet"
181, Thank you Rich
182," And thank you, Joan"
183,"  ***    Across our work in state government, of course it's a priority that we continue to engage with our tribal partners"
184, Our tribal partners are sovereign nations with which we share geography
185," The tribal enrolled members are also citizens of North Dakota, and it's our job as elected leaders in North Dakota to serve all citizens of North Dakota"
186,"   Last year, we reached an agreement with MHA Nation over the sharing of tax revenue on wells that straddled the edge of the Fort Berthold reservation"
187, This settlement helped take care of an unresolved tax agreement with the Three Affiliated Tribes and added that
188," In October, Chairman Fox and I, that was a great point of collaboration"
189,"   In October, there was more"
190," Chairman Fox and I signed what could be the first of what we hope will be many, including with all the tribes, mutual aid agreements with our tribal nations, allowing the nearest available law enforcement officer to respond to an emergency call, regardless of jurisdiction"
191,"  Folks, it's 2022"
192, It's America
193, A 911 dispatcher in our state should not have to ask someone if they're an enrolled member or not before they can determine which law enforcement agency can respond to an emergency in their home
194," This MOU that we signed with MHA, which MHA spans five counties, takes care of state, county, local, tribal"
195, Everybody in law enforcement's protected
196, Everybody knows how to make it work
197, All the tribes can benefit from this kind of agreement
198, I want to thank everybody on the North Dakota Highway Patrol team that helped make that happen
199,  The legislature also advanced a bill that would allow all tribes to sign collaboration agreements with the North Dakota IT Department to enter into agreements with the tribes to assist them with cybersecurity response
200, This is also super important because our networks are integrated
201," We've celebrated victories together with our tribes, but there's so much more work to be done"
202," But I can tell you from the meetings that we've had in the last six months, the spirit of collaboration is alive and well between the state of North Dakota and the tribes"
203,"  We all have a common desire to work for solutions to the challenges for the benefit of all North Dakotans, including the tribal members living across our great state"
204, These are our neighbors and our fellow citizens
205,  ***  Living in the land of the free and the home of the brave is something for which I know that we're all grateful
206," In North Dakota, we value and respect police officers who enforce the law, and we value and respect military service members who defend our most cherished freedoms"
207," As some states, and some of the iconic major cities of our nation, in the last two years have somehow chosen to tolerate lawlessness, they've chosen to defund their police, North Dakota and our cities, we've been backing the blue"
208," Last April, I had the privilege of signing legislation that provides health insurance benefits to the spouse and children of any emergency responder whose life is taken in the line of duty"
209,    And we pray for the safety of our North Dakota National Guard soldiers that are stationed both at home and abroad
210," And when I say at home, I mean including in Texas, securing our southwest border"
211, The states have stepped up to address this incredible border crisis that the current administration apparently refuses to even fix or even acknowledge
212, And we're showing our appreciation for our National Guard soldiers and airmen with more than just words
213, We fully funded the National Guard Tuition Assistance Program
214, We've approved dollars to lease land to expand the training range at Camp Grafton
215," And we've worked with lawmakers to exempt military retirement pay from state income tax, because those who serve their country have already paid society's tab"
216,"  We also extended the exemption to surviving spouses because we know when a family member serves in the military, so does the family"
217, These are small acts of appreciation to honor the courageous service of our military servicemen and women
218, It helps promote workforce participation
219, It will help those that have served in the military in North Dakota to choose to perhaps retire here
220, And it puts us on a path of our goal to make North Dakota the most military-friendly state in the nation
221,"  I'd now like to ask that all current service members, all military veterans, anybody who served in the police forces, or currently serves the police forces, to stand up, so we can express our unending gratitude to all of you"
222, Thank you for your service
223," I see Chairman Fox standing up over here, U"
224,S
225, Marines
226, Native Americans serve at a higher level than any other group in the country
227, Thank you and thank everybody else
228,"  ***  Just as law and order is essential to safe, healthy communities, so is infrastructure"
229," Not only the physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and flood protection, but also the infrastructure that supports strong workforce, strong families, and strong communities"
230, Both of these types of infrastructure are necessary for us to thrive
231," Let's take a look at the huge strides we've made this past year and where we need to do more in the future, especially on workforce"
232,  We entered 2021 with a bold proposal to our legislators: to pass the largest infrastructure bonding package in state history
233," Listening to the warnings of economists and reading the writing on the wall, seeing all the federal money being printed, we predicted that inflation would soar over a year ago with a massive influx of federal government spending, and also inflation because I have to say, the current administration's misguided economic policies, which are driving energy prices up"
234,"   Turns out we were right, unfortunately"
235," But last week, we learned that inflation had climbed to the fastest pace in 40 years, up a staggering 7"
236,5% from a year earlier
237, And North Dakotans are feeling the pinch
238," As inflation rises, so does the cost of borrowing money and higher interest rates"
239,     That's why we pushed so hard to pass our historic bonding bill last spring
240," That swift action, those bonds have already been issued, low interest rates have been secured"
241, They're taken at a time when interest rates were at a historic low
242," This is going to save, the legislature taking action last year is going to save tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars as we upgrade our roads and bridges, build new flood projects, and finish the ones we've started, work on water supply projects for our citizens"
243,"  And we are wisely using the Legacy Fund earnings, not the principal, the earnings, to pay off those bonds, so we don't have to use $1 of taxes of the state citizens"
244, This was a financially conservative thing to do
245, We thank our legislators for embracing the tool of bonding at this strategic time
246,"   With the costs of goods, services, and materials rising, we've moved quickly to get the biggest bang on our federal dollars that have come through"
247," And while some states were waiting until their regular session, our legislature acted"
248, They moved quickly
249," With a special session, we deployed those ARPA dollars in November"
250, And we're avoiding some of the corrosive power of inflation and putting ourselves at a competitive advantage over states that have yet to act on their federal aid
251, That's smart
252," It's conservative, and it's really great in terms of how we're doing cash management"
253,"   In this biennium alone, we've made a record level of strategic investments in infrastructure, $2"
254,3 billion
255, That brings our five-year total in our administration to over $6 billion invested in physical infrastructure
256,"  And this of course, right here, since we're in Fargo, we need to mention the $435 million bonding package for the Fargo, Moorhead, West Fargo, Horace, Harwood area diversion project"
257," That enabled the project officials, that bonding, to close the contractor agreement, lock in lower pricing through a private-public partnership"
258," In fact, the U"
259,S
260," Army Corps of Engineers has estimated that because of that action taken last year, and now the bidding with the private-public partnership completed, without that the diversion would've taken until 2042, 15 years after what is now the estimated completion date"
261, That cost of taking 15 years longer would've been $330 million more
262,"  Instead, the diversion is now 35% complete"
263," Substantial completion is slated for spring of 2027, reducing catastrophic flood risk to a metro area that includes over 20% of the K-12 kids in our state, over 25% of the current hospital capacity in our state, over $25 billion of property value, and an entire university and 55 and growing K-12 schools"
264," This protection, protecting this metro area, this couldn't have happened without the work of our legislature, without the work of city and county leadership across the border into Minnesota"
265, Wouldn't have happened without the work and collaboration with the state of Minnesota and their governors
266," And it wouldn't have happened without the hard work of our Congressional delegation, especially Senator John Hoeven, who helped secure the federal funding that completed the whole project"
267,"    By completing this project faster, we're reducing risk"
268, We're saving homeowners thousands of dollars each
269," Cumulatively, it's tens of millions of dollars annually being saved that will no longer have to go towards flood insurance in the metro area"
270," And we're protecting all of this property value, all the hospitals, everything I've talked about"
271," So it's really incredible, but so many people in this room were involved in that"
272," But I do want to say one other thing because I look around the room and I know there's people here that I've been with, and we've been shoulder to shoulder"
273, And we've been stacking sandbags for the last – my lifetime in Fargo
274," So anyway, I'd just like to say I think I've done enough stacking of sandbags"
275," So I want to thank everybody that was involved in this, to say thank you"
276, It's about time we got this thing done
277,"  Before Governor Guy passed away in his 90s, and he'd grown up Amenia, my dad grew up in Arthur, they knew each other from college at NDSU"
278, They were in the same fraternity
279, They knew each other
280, They both signed up for World War II at the same time in a line in Casselton at the gym
281," He asked me about 15 years ago to go out to lunch, and when I was just working here in Fargo"
282," And what he wanted to talk about was, and it was after we'd had some big floods in Fargo, and he wanted to talk about, hey, you know in the '30s, there was a drought"
283, It was an extended drought
284, The city almost ran out of water
285, He'd been working on Garrison Diversion as governor from 1960 to 1972
286," He's like, ""That's something that has to get done"
287,"""   This legislature has committed an additional $50 million for the Red River Water Supply Project"
288, It's going to provide emergency water supply to central and eastern North Dakota
289, And we're talking about providing water to 40% to 45% of the people in the state
290, We're talking about the entire Red River Valley and everything that's outside of the Missouri River Basin
291, It's a huge piece of our economic engine
292, But we're going to have this backup water supply
293," It's only been promised, it's been pursued, it's been planned, for six decades"
294, It's going back to the '60s
295,  We're finally getting ready to have a drop of Missouri water cross the continental divide and come to the eastern part of the state
296," This is why we went through the pain of flooding the land, the tribal lands, the state lands, flooded all of this great bottom land in the Missouri River, which everybody loves now for fishing, but all that flooding of all that acreage was meant to provide a million acres of irrigation and water supply for the rest of the state"
297, That was the vision of Garrison Diversion
298, It wasn't all about fishing
299," We love the fishing, but it's not a million acres, we're irrigating about 11,000 acres"
300,  There's not been a drop of water come to the east
301," We finally have a chance to get this thing done, that along with NAWS to get Missouri River water up to the north central part of the state, Minot and the Souris River Basin"
302, These are huge things
303, The legislature understands this
304, They're investing in this infrastructure
305, And this will provide more certainty and resiliency for our farmers and ranchers in the rest of our state
306, They know they can rely on the abundant clean water supply provided by the Missouri
307," And like flood protection for Fargo, these water supply projects, super critical"
308, It's about time
309, Give yourselves a hand for helping to make this happen
310," Way to go, team"
311,"    And of course, these days in addition to the physical infrastructure of water projects, bridges, highways, whether it's telehealth, behavioral health, education, connecting every combine and every tractor, we have got to have the world's leading broadband access"
312, And we continue to position ourselves in that way
313, State lawmakers committed an additional $45 million in federal funds for building out our broadband infrastructure
314, We already led the nation before that $45 million investment
315," We literally were the best in the country in terms of when the pandemic hit, we could reach 99% of our students had an access to internet at home"
316, That was higher than any other state in the country
317, We can be the first state in the nation to achieve 100% broadband access
318,  And we're not talking dial up speeds
319, We're talking gigabit type speeds
320," Why does that matter? It levels the playing field for everybody as a citizen, and for students, and it levels the playing field for our small communities where people can now literally work from anywhere for almost any company in the world, regardless of geographic or demographics"
321, It is a huge advantage
322, We're in the front
323, Let's keep building on our lead
324, Let's make it happen
325," Way to go, North Dakota"
326,"  ***  But as we invest in all this future, some people might say, ""Wow, where are all the dollars going?"" But I want you to know again, working with the legislature, we're also saving for the future"
327,"   Thanks to conservative budgeting, prudent fiscal management, our state's reserve funds are in better shape than they ever have been"
328, The rainy day Budget Stabilization Fund sits at $750 million
329," In Century Code, that's it's cap, that's as filled as it can fill"
330," The Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund will have an unobligated balance of more than $900 million, unobligated balance in just a cash checking account by June of 2023 if the current oil prices continue"
331," And based on the current conservative forecast, and I say conservative because we've been tracking ahead of that the first eight months of this biennium, the Legacy Fund will have nearly tripled in value in just eight years by the end of this biennium, from $3"
332,3 billion in 2015 to $9
333,3 billion
334,   These reserve funds and our strategic use of federal funding has allowed us to provide historic tax relief during this special session
335," We approved an estimated $211 million in income tax credits, allowing approximately half, half of North Dakotans, get to keep their hard earned money"
336," The people that were working during the pandemic were the people that have income tax to pay, they get to keep their money in their pocket"
337," We also have permanently eliminated the state income tax on Social Security income, saving our seniors nearly $15 million over the next two years"
338,"   We know that when it comes to taxes though, our citizens are concerned about property taxes"
339, Property taxes are locally levied
340, This is the thing that hits many of our citizens the hardest
341, And the state has been for the last decade trying to do their part to lessen that impact
342, The current   budget includes $175 million in local property tax relief because the state continued to cover the cost of county social services that used to be done by local property taxes
343, The state also is providing $1
344,2 billion in property tax relief through a school funding formula this biennium
345," That's this biennium, $1"
346,2 billion that would only a decade ago have been paid locally is now being paid by the state
347,  But we still have a problem
348," With inflation coming, with people moving to North Dakota, with supply chain issues, property valuations are rising, home prices are going up, inflation is driving properties up"
349," When property values go up, valuations go up"
350," And unless a school district, a city and a county, or a park district, unless they lower their mill rate, unless they lower their tax rate, their revenue's going to go up"
351," So as citizens, we can have local officials say, ""We didn't raise your taxes,"" but they're getting more revenue with inflation"
352," And everybody calls their state legislator and says, ""Do something about property taxes"
353,"""  We have to fix the problem at the local level"
354," It's up to all of us as North Dakota residents to ensure that when we're doing these local property tax dollars, to ensure that when we're doing this thing, that we're giving feedback to those locally elected leaders, and that they're making smart decisions, and that they're being used effectively and as efficiently as possible at the local level"
355,"  We've made progress on tax relief, but we can't stop there"
356, We need to continue finding ways to simplify our tax code
357," We need to create a better business tax environment, particularly now when we're competing"
358, We need to make sure that we're cutting red tape and cutting regulation to make sure that people that want to live in our state can
359," And we have to make sure that any attempt at state-funded property tax relief actually finds its way to the citizens, rather than being slowly eroded through property value increases, fiscally uneconomic premature growth of public-funded infrastructure on the edges of our city"
360,  This economics piece is simple
361, Private capital that flows to an area in any city where there's existing infrastructure is a winner for all taxpayers
362, Public capital projects on the Greenfield edges of our communities literally do not pay for themselves and cost taxpayers money
363, This is a lesson we need to learn at all levels of government
364, Continued smart tax reform is the key priority over the next 10 months
365," Our administration will work with the state tax commissioner, OMB director, key legislators, to work to bring meaningful tax reform proposals to the 68th Legislative Assembly in North Dakota"
366,"  We've got the smarts, the brains, and the people and the dollars to be able to fix this"
367, And it starts with how we design our communities
368, Our citizens work hard for their money
369," We should work even harder at government to make sure that we aren't taxing them, that we're not taxing them unnecessarily and that we're not designing cities that aren't sustainable financially into the future"
370,  ***     The adversity that past generations overcame on these unforgiving plains has been passed down as the North Dakota work ethic that we know today
371,"   Our farmers and ranchers take great pride in their productivity, and they should"
372," In spite of that record-breaking drought, a global pandemic, a federal administration that seems bent on opposing our state, our farmers and ranchers have continued to show the way and why they lead in feeding the nation"
373," As of this last year's harvest, North Dakota continued to lead the nation in edible beans, canola, flaxseed, and of course, very sweet that we lead in honey"
374," Remaining the top five, barley, chickpeas, oats, sugar beets, rye, sunflowers, and wheat"
375," Corn, wheat and soybeans are still our top three crops"
376,   And our citizens have always been innovators
377, Our farmers have always been leaders
378, They've always been driving their productivity forward
379,  And this can be seen by the Grand Farm project here in Cass County
380," Just this week, along with over a dozen legislators that were present, we announced that Grand Farm will receive a $10 million grant"
381," And this is something that had been proposed in our Accelerate ND, the legislature approved it in November"
382, It's going to be matched with private dollars to take at a national and international level for this area to lead the world in autonomous ag technology
383,"   The opportunities for collaboration using the Grand Farm vision, tying together NDSU, our Extension, which touches every county in the state, the huge private sector investments that we have in agriculture and agriculture automation and investment in technology here in our state"
384," We've got a potential to transform agriculture here at home, and at the same time, address the workforce challenges that face the agriculture industry"
385," Our leadership in ag tech, it doesn't stop there"
386,"  Bushel, an ag tech software company located right here in Fargo, is a leader in digital infrastructure for the grain industry"
387, Their technology has led to the largest network of growers and grain buyers in the United States
388," Currently, more than 60,000 farmers, 2,000 grain handling facilities in the U"
389,S
390, and Canada are utilizing Bushel's innovative technology
391,"   In 2020, with the support of Commerce’s innovation and technology loan fund, Bushel was able to expand even further and add additional team members"
392," Bushel's CEO and co-founder, Jake Joraanstad, was helping lead this charge"
393, He's not able to be here in person today
394," But Bushel's vice president of product, Dane Braun, and director of engineering, Nathan Joraanstad, are here to represent the company as an example of how North Dakota can lead in ag tech"
395," Let's hear it for Dane, Nathan, and Jake, and the entire Bushel team"
396, You guys should watch out
397," The last time we announced a company at the State of the State, six months later it got bought for $9"
398,6 billion
399," But you guys are on a good roll, way to go"
400,"   ***    Our ag industry can thrive without a healthy energy – our ag industry, I'm sorry, can't, cannot thrive, especially today, without a healthy energy industry to provide stable baseload power, reliable natural gas, propane and other fuels"
401," And then also, they fuel those value-added plants, but it's also that energy is the value-added feed stock for creating fertilizer"
402,"  Likewise, on the flip side, our energy industry needs a healthy ag industry to survive"
403, Agriculture creates markets for our energy products and value-added products
404," We today support a $632 million and growing ethanol market in North Dakota across four plants, and that creates a local market for over 180 million bushels of corn"
405," Never before like we are right now, ag and energy need each other"
406," And we're so uniquely positioned compared to almost any other state because we've got these two powerhouse industries, ag and energy"
407, And they can work together
408,"  But what's happening to both of them, nationally there's a movement of capital away from traditional investments in both ag and energy"
409," These investments are based on what's called ESG, environmental, social, or governance metrics"
410," They're driving more than $45 million – not million, sorry"
411," Not B, T"
412," $45 trillion in capital away from our two largest industries at a time when we need it most, when those industries need to be innovating, ESG is a form of regulation"
413," It's a form of shareholder pressure, which is taking that innovation away"
414,"   According to the projections from the United Nations, global food production is going to need to double by 2050 to meet the demands of a growing global population, both for bodies and increase in need of protein"
415,"  Likewise, our energy industry is vital for ensuring our future survival"
416, Our nation is losing baseload energy production at a time when we need uninterrupted power
417," And again, the policies are trying to disrupt the things that have allowed us as a nation to never worry when we flip on a light switch because we've all spent our whole life knowing that without even thinking about it, we've had the best grid in the country"
418,  So Lieutenant Governor Sanford and myself and legislators and dozens of other people worked last spring
419, There was a dozen bills passed by the 67th Legislature to support ag and energy production
420," Bills that created the new Ag Diversification Fund, the Clean Sustainable Energy Fund"
421, These were historic and they're a great start
422, We recognize that there's even more opportunity in North Dakota
423," That's why in May of last year, we announced a goal of making North Dakota the first carbon neutral state in the nation by the end of the decade"
424,"  Of the 50 states, ours is the best positioned to help our nation and the world transition to a carbon constrained future"
425," And at the same time, providing reliable, resilient, affordable, clean energy for our children and grandchildren"
426, We can do both
427," In North Dakota, it is “and,” not “or"
428,” We don't have to give up stable baseload
429, We don't have to give up destroying our economy
430, We don't have to ask OPEC to produce more energy to lower the price of gas at a pump in North Dakota and across our country
431, We can produce that here today
432,    Our goal that we have of 2030 will involve no new mandates
433," It will be achieved purely through innovation, not regulation"
434," By focusing on innovation over regulation, we can harness the geologic jackpot under our feet in North Dakota to capture and store far more carbon than we currently produce"
435,   It makes total sense
436, We've got the technology
437, We've created the regulatory framework
438, The legislature on everything from pore space to unitization to becoming the first state in the nation that could authorize and permit a Class VI well for CO2 storage
439, We have the things in place
440," That's why the capital is coming here now like we've never seen it, because of the work that the legislature's done, the work that Lynn Helms and his team has done, Dave Glatt and his team has done"
441, We're in a position where we can attract ESG dollars for the first time instead of driving them away
442," And that $45 trillion is headed our way because we can solve problems today, not in the future"
443,  We are already global leaders in producing food and fuel efficiently
444, North Dakota ranks 10th in the nation in reducing carbon intensity from energy production over the last 20 years
445," With our technology, ag producers are gaining more efficiency with more than an eight-fold increase in row crop yields over the last century"
446,   Potential synergies between ag and energy keep coming together
447," Last year, they came together in one project in perfect harmony, as a great example"
448," After months of working behind the scenes, we were able to announce that ADM, a fantastic global company in ag and in energy and in fuels, will be building North Dakota's first dedicated soybean crushing plant and refinery at Spiritwood, 10 miles east of Jamestown"
449,"   This $350 million soybean crush and refining complex is going to create 70 permanent jobs, process 150,000 barrels of soybeans a day, roughly one quarter of our state’s soybean production"
450," It creates a huge local market for soybean growers, improves their profitability, reduces our dependence on having to ship soybeans in raw form to foreign competitors that we may be in trade wars with"
451, We can add value to it right here
452," So not only it's a win for ag producers, it's also a win for the oil refiners, and it's a win for the environment"
453,"  The soybean oil, this is a market that's going to be driven by oil, not by meal"
454, Soybean oil taken from that plant at Spiritwood will be shipped to the Marathon Refinery in Dickinson to be refined into renewable green diesel
455," It'll be sold into such states as California at a huge premium, maybe as high as $1 a gallon, to meet their fuel standards"
456,  So let's just stop for a second
457," We got a soybean that we used to grow, put on a train, ship it and export it"
458, Now we have a soybean
459," We take it, we process it, we turn it into soybean oil"
460," We take it and we process it again, turn it into green diesel in Dickinson"
461," We're adding value to that same soybean three times, not once"
462, This is how we keep tripling our economy
463, We can do this over and over and over again
464,    We have a diverse portfolio of over 50 different types of farm commodities in North Dakota
465, We can grow just about anything
466, We know we've got over 800 years' worth of lignite coal
467," People say so what? We decarbonize it, which we're doing right now, and it's one of the greatest baseload sources ever"
468," More than 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil, over 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and with the sixth-best wind resource in the nation"
469," The all-of-the-above energy approach, we are truly positioned to both feed and fuel the world"
470,"  When we talk about having the jackpot of geology, look at those numbers"
471, It is incredible
472, We should get up every day and just pour gratitude out of ourselves that we were all North Dakotans sitting on top of this soil and these God-given resources
473, And now we've got the innovation to take advantage of them and do things that others around the world would only dream of doing
474, But this all-of-the-above requires balance
475, Government has got to figure out when the time is to get out of the way
476," We've got to figure out a way to ensure a level playing field so that the federal government trying to pick winners and losers across energy sources, as opposed to trying to support those that are doing the most to get rid the CO2"
477, Our baseload sources must continue to thrive
478,"  Last summer, we were pleased to announce that a buyer had been found for Coal Creek Station"
479," An entrepreneur, a risk taker, a North Dakota company"
480, This is our largest power plant
481," Not only has this saved 300 jobs at the plant itself at Coal Creek, but it's saving over 500 jobs at Falkirk Mine"
482," It also ensured that over 1,100 megawatts of baseload will remain on the grid"
483," That's not only good news for us and for Minnesota, who gets 45% of their electricity from North Dakota, but it's good news for Dallas, Texas the next time it gets cold in the South"
484,  This deal wouldn't have happened if we didn't have what we've been talking about
485," If we didn't have the associated carbon capture project that the state's been working on for over a decade, if we didn't have the regulatory framework, and we didn't have the ability to put our largest standalone wind farm right next there to also take wind energy and push it down that direct current line"
486, This all-of-the-above energy approach is working
487,"  There are so many people to thank on this, starting with the entrepreneurs and engineers"
488," Loren Kopseng, Stacy Tschider from Rainbow Energy, for their vision, for their tenacity, overcoming 20 different things that were put in front of the place"
489, Al Christenson from Great River Energy for his instrumental role
490," But leading the charge again on this example, Lieutenant Governor Brent Stanford"
491, So let's give everybody a hand for making this thing happen
492, Way to go
493,  We are already well on our way towards meeting our carbon neutral goal for 2030
494," In December, we approved the first round of grants from the Clean Sustainable Energy Fund that the legislature created this last year"
495, The approved projects from that first grant round will sequester 18 million tons of CO2
496, That represents over 31% of our current annual production
497, So we're off to a good start
498, But we know that we have the room to store so much more
499, We can store 252 billion tons of CO2 in North Dakota
500," That's 4,400 years of our state's annual carbon production"
501,"  But why stop with North Dakota? We have an enormous opportunity not just to store our own carbon, but to store our neighbors' carbon"
502," We can store the entire nation's CO2 for the next 50   years if people could figure out how to get it here, which is why it's exciting that we've got groups working on building CO2 pipelines to bring that CO2 here for us to store it 7,000 feet underground safely"
503,"  Since announcing the goal around carbon neutrality, we've seen this massive increase in the flow of capital to North Dakota"
504, I have to say that we knew that it would unleash capital
505, It's coming in at a faster rate than even we expected
506," In fact, our Department of Commerce has now engaged in over $30 billion of identified projects where people have indicated an interest in coming to our state to invest in value-added energy or value-added ag"
507,   These projects are coming here because we embrace innovation
508, They're coming here because of our business friendly environment
509, They're coming because of our geologic storage capacity
510, They're coming here because of the energy that we have that they can use to run their plants
511, And they're coming here because we're the first state in the nation that actually can permit a Class VI well and store it and pay the landowners for that CO2
512, That's all innovation
513,  It's time for us to keep our foot on the accelerator
514," Not only take advantage of this incredible competitive advantage we have on carbon storage, but use it to enhance our oil production by more than 8 billion barrels"
515, We can have carbon neutral and carbon negative oil companies in North Dakota
516," We can use it to grow year-round food and greenhouses like the projects at MHA, seven football fields in size"
517," They're going to use excess heat, they're going to take CO2, they're going to put it into the greenhouse"
518, Things will grow faster
519," And we can use that natural gas that we have today that we're flaring as feedstock for manufacturing, and we can and use it for all kinds of other projects"
520,  We are positioned to lead the world in this entire new developing industry around the carbon storage markets
521," It's time for us to take that lead and usher in an entire new, never seen before economic development phase for North Dakota"
522,  ***  What's the result for the average citizen when we do all this? It leads me to another challenge for us as policymakers
523, Let's design a state where we have a shot at becoming the No
524, 1 among all 50 states in per capita GDP
525," GDP, gross domestic product"
526, It's a measure of the total aggregate amount of economic activity in a state divided by the number of people
527," We have a huge chance to be able to do that, and we're well on our way to becoming No"
528, 1 with these $30 billion of projects
529,"  If you take the last year alone, $350 million, the crush plant we talked about in Spiritwood; $350 possibly going to $700 million, corn wet milling plant in Grand Forks; $2"
530,"8 billion gas-to-liquids complex that's been announced for Williams County; the hydrogen hub near Beulah, which could be several billion dollars; $1"
531,9 billion data center announcement that I was at in Williston a couple weeks ago; $4
532,5 billion carbon capture pipeline and storage project running from Iowa to North Dakota
533," Last year, we were fourth in the nation in GDP"
534," We were behind Washington,   Massachusetts, and New York"
535, We have an advantage
536," Small number of people, huge number of resources"
537," With all of these projects that are in this development pipeline, we have a shot at doing it"
538, Let's put that as a goal
539, Let's go make it happen
540,  Our manufacturing sector is also thriving
541, Tens of millions of dollars in new investment being launched last year
542," Garage door manufacturing, making sand for the oil fracking processes"
543," Our manufacturing success story that we know of all of these, there was one that was the most fun of all of our manufacturing this year"
544, Everybody loves it
545," North Dakota, now the world's favorite snack product, Dot's Pretzels"
546,"   Dorothy Henke took a special treat that she made for her family and friends, brought it to a Pride of Dakota event in Williston"
547," Ten years later, an idea that started in Velva is now known around the world"
548, Her success led to the acquisition of Dot's Pretzels by Hershey Company for a combined purchase price of $1
549,2 billion this last fall
550," That's a new record for a Pride of Dakota company, by the way"
551, Dorothy's not here today
552," She's busy making pretzels, but she's watching online"
553, So join me in congratulating Dorothy and her entire team in celebrating her success
554, Way to go
555,"  As we continue to diversify the economy through biosciences, technology, and unmanned aerial systems, the sale of Fargo biotech leader Aldevron to Danaher for $9"
556,6 billion certainly put North Dakota's biotech industry on the global map
557,   We continue to be the nation's proving ground for UAS technology
558," Grand Sky tenants and partners employ 187 people actually at the park, which houses aircraft"
559," Now with the new refurbishing of the Global Hawk project, with the federal government, and Northrop Grumman, there's aircraft over $2"
560,5 billion coming to Grand Forks to be refurbished
561, We're rolling out even more of our statewide Vantis network
562," This is the air traffic control system for UAS, allows operations beyond visual line of sight"
563," That innovation, again, begun over a decade ago"
564," Supported by the legislature, tied in with the University in North Dakota, tied in with federal"
565, That investment of nearly $50 million
566, The sky is truly the limit it for that exciting industry
567, Over 40 UAS startup companies now around Grand Forks
568,  Our No
569," 3 industry, tourism, has become even a more important sector during the pandemic"
570, People are getting out and about
571," Arts, culture, community events, along with outdoor activities are attracting visitors as citizens seek more experiences in new places and in the open air of nature"
572, We've seen this like no place in our Parks and Rec Department
573," Comparing to 2021, the last normal year of tourism, pre-pandemic 2019, 42% jump in visitation"
574, Increases from all other 49 states in terms of increased number of visitation to North Dakota
575,"  We're also excited that our state is going to have another destination to promote when the Theodore Roosevelt Library and Museum opens in Medora on July 4th, 2026 is the target opening"
576, That's the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence
577, A 93-acre site's been acquired by the TR Library Foundation through the great work of our CODEL and others from the federal government
578, Generous donors have given more than $100 million to the project so   far
579," And again, our CODEL worked at the federal level, they secured $39 million to fix and enhance the scenic road loop in Theodore Roosevelt National Park"
580," So between the national park, the Medora Foundation, the library, the repaired road and other enhancements, our state's top tourist attraction will be bigger and better than ever in the years ahead"
581,"  It takes vision, passion, and dedication to create places of adventure"
582," Sometimes we think about big checks and state government, the federal government, but this is a great story of an individual and his determination"
583," Nick Ybarra and his wife, Lindsey, they've done just that"
584, Nick fell in love with the Maah Daah Hey Trail
585," It's an incredible 144-mile, single-track hiking, biking, and horseback trail through the heart of the Badlands"
586, It connects the north and the south units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park
587, When he heard and saw that the U
588,S
589," Forest Service was no longer maintaining the trail, he didn't sit back"
590, Nick and his family dedicated themselves to saving the Maah Daah Hey and turning that track into an adventurer's dream
591,  Nick literally went out when it was a 110-mile trail and mowed it by hand multiple times a summer
592," I had a chance, I ran into him at a campground in western North Dakota, and I said, ""Man, you must be Nick Ybarra"
593," Is it true that you really drove a DR self-propelled mower the whole 110 miles?"" And he said, ""No, that's not true"
594,""" And I said, ""Oh, wow"
595, Okay
596," Well, that makes me feel better because I thought that was incredible"
597,""" And he said, ""It's 220 miles"
598, I had to get back home
599,""" So anyway, this is an individual"
600," But Nick, they created the Save the MDH"
601, People are donating to that
602," The donors and volunteers now working, 500-plus people showed up last year for some of the bike races"
603," But I want to say thanks to individuals like Nick and his wife, taking the initiative to keep this important trail alive"
604,  All of us that love the outdoors and are outdoorsmen know that hunting and fishing are the heritage in North Dakota
605, Both continue to be major draws that help drive tourism dollars and in-state tourism dollars
606," Last fall, North Dakota became the first state in the nation to utilize electronic posting to bridge the gap between landowners and hunters"
607," This spring, North Dakota Game and Fish will also make us the first state in the nation, this is exciting, 100% online licensing"
608, Way to go
609, You can get your license from home
610," Way to go, Game and Fish"
611, Good job
612,"  If you're not into fishing and you think that Minnesota equals fishing, check out any of the lakes in North Dakota"
613," When you go there, you're going to see a bunch of Minnesota license plates"
614, Why? Because our Game and Fish continues to manage a record number of fishing lakes with stocking 448 bodies of water
615, That's a 200% increase in the last 22 years
616," Over this period of time, total fishing license sales have increased by more than 50,000 annually in our state"
617,  Hunting and fishing are big businesses in North Dakota
618, They contribute significantly to Main Street in our small rural communities
619," They're supporting the skilled workforce, they're supporting economic diversity"
620," So again, that's really key"
621,   Our state parks contribute to this
622," A lot of times, people that want to fish are staying at a state park"
623," They've been major contributors to the quality of life and the vibrancy, especially with their neighboring communities"
624," And as I said, last year, record attendance again"
625," 97,241 campsite   rental nights in 2021"
626, I want to thank the legislature
627," They put together, in capital funding, the most money that we've ever seen to help upgrade and fix and restore roads and toilets and infrastructure within our state parks to make them more appealing to our citizens"
628," Thank you, legislature, for that"
629,  But we can do more to promote and utilize our state's natural treasures while still preserving them for future generations
630," Enhancing our outdoor recreation opportunities is a tool to recruit new people who want to live in North Dakota, families that want to come here and raise their kids"
631," Workers that want to work here, and not just work here for two weeks and head home, to come here and stay here"
632, Engaging in outdoor activities is one of the things that can be a competitive advantage for us
633," We also know it's got benefits for our physical, our mental, and our emotional health"
634," So I want to say, again, grateful to legislature for supporting all of these outdoor investments"
635, We encourage our public and private partners to continue investing in the North Dakota outdoors
636, There's going to be opportunities to do that through matching grants and through foundations
637, So stay tuned for more news there
638,"  ***  Our economy is growing, as we've talked about, and our infrastructure is second to none"
639, Rainy day funds are full
640, Pretty good spot to be in
641, But now we've got to also direct our folks and resources to the infrastructure that really is the core of our state
642, And that's what can we do to support strong families and strong communities
643,"  We, as a state, invest as much in education as just about anyone, as close to 50% of our general fund goes between K-12 and higher ed"
644, But our people need support and they need increased flexibility and workforce mobility
645," Our citizens deserve high-quality education for all ages, from early childhood education all the way through higher education to adult retraining"
646," And our families, to be able to work, they need to have affordable and reliable child care"
647, Our communities need behavioral health resources and amenities for all generations
648,"  Thanks again to the work of the 67th Special Assembly and the Accelerate ND plan, we've already started this important work"
649," Three months ago, we signed over $250 million, including matching requirements, that were dedicated to addressing our workforce needs"
650, These funds will advance the connection between workforce and education through career academies across our state
651," Already, the State Board of Career and Technical Education has awarded a combined total of $20 million into three initial grants to career centers in Dickinson, Minot, and Watford City"
652," And just this week, the review committee recommended allocating the remaining $68 million for career academies in other cities across the state"
653,"   Nearly $40 million will be used, $40 million additionally, to create the first polytechnic, or hands-on training center, in North Dakota at Bismarck State College to build programs and curriculum to meet the needs of both students and their future employers"
654, Millions more will be directed to regional workforce ideas and solutions through grant programs approved by the legislature
655, And nearly $20 million will be used to make progress on reliable child care
656,    This is just the beginning
657," Over the next year, our administration will continue to work with businesses, associations, and licensing boards to cut red tape"
658, We can and must be dedicated to creating the most open and transferable occupational licensing system in the nation
659," In a state like we are, where we're located and its rural nature, we have to make it easier"
660, Easiest would be great
661," We have to make it easier, not harder, to come work in North Dakota than other states"
662," Flexibility will not completely solve our workforce challenges, but it'll make a big dent"
663,"  We've seen tremendous success in the past with the automation tax credit that the legislature provided businesses with, supports needed to change unwanted jobs into automated processes, and reskilling team members for dependable long-term careers"
664, The first year that that automation tax credit came was in 2013
665, 107 businesses have benefited over that timeframe
666,"   I'm recommending that in 2023, the legislature, we double down on this tax credit"
667, We make it the most ambitious and most expansive workforce tool yet
668," The combination of removing the red tape for licensing, increasing support for automation"
669," And that automation, whether it's manufacturing, whether it's warehouses, whether it's in biosciences or manufacturing, whatever it is, we have an opportunity to be training the people that can run the automation, as opposed to doing the mundane jobs"
670,"  That's going to create a better and higher-paying career for people here, and we're not going to have to be completely capped always on our growth by the number of people that want to move to North Dakota"
671, We should actually be the leader in automation in the nation
672, It's one way for us to be having to fight less for all the people that may want to live someplace other than North Dakota
673, So automation is key to our long-term success
674,"  (Robot enters stage) Wow, speaking of automation"
675," Well, they knew I might be running out of water by now"
676, Thank you
677," I want everybody to meet Otto, made by the NDSU robotics club just in the past week"
678, Go Bison
679," Take a spin so they can see your logos there, Otto"
680, Isn't that nice? Anyway
681," Oh, there's a nice note here"
682, Okay
683, There's a couple of notes here as a matter of fact
684, The first one says 
685,
686,
687," Oh, it's from Kathryn"
688," Oh, that's so nice"
689," ""Hi sweetie, you're doing a great job"
690, Remember to hydrate
691,""" Okay"
692," ""Love Kathryn"
693, Go Bison
694,""" So that's great"
695, And then there's another note here
696, This is actually from Mayor Mahoney
697," “We knew the governor would run long, so we not going to be ticketing anybody in downtown Fargo"
698,"” So thank you, mayor"
699, And let's give it up for the NDSU robotics team and Otto
700, Thank you
701, Take a bow
702, Pops a wheelie on the way out
703, Sweet
704, That's nice
705,"  ***  We know that for the good people of North Dakota to thrive at work, they need to know that their family is safe, their family's happy, their family's healthy"
706, And that increasingly means having access to quality affordable child care
707,     The child care industry is the foundation of the success of every other business
708, It allows tens of thousands of North Dakota parents to participate in the workforce
709," As the pandemic has illustrated, both here and across the nation, shortages of affordable child care can impede the success of our employers, hurting productivity and forcing parents to exit the workforce in ways that threaten our economic growth"
710, Child care challenges are felt by families and by the providers as well
711," The average cost of infant child care in North Dakota now is more than $9,000 per year"
712, Yet many providers struggle with razor-thin margins
713, This creates an unstable business model
714, The parents can't pay more and providers can't make less
715,"  Our administration recognizes the importance of this industry to North Dakota's families, its businesses, and the economy, and we're taking action"
716," That's why in the last six months, we've announced over $117 million in federal funding to support the child care sector in our state"
717, And yesterday we announced that we have expanded eligibility for child care assistance by increasing household income limits to include more working families
718,"  In the coming months, we'll launch a series of business roundtables to talk with business leaders, child care providers, and families across North Dakota about the challenges regarding lack of quality, affordable and accessible child care"
719," And in April, we're going to launch a workforce retention initiative that will allow child care providers to provide extra dollars to the employees who do the everyday work of caring for kids"
720," In May, we'll roll out ND3, a partnership with North Dakota employers who want to offer child care benefits to their employees"
721," And this summer, we'll finalize a comprehensive strategy to ensure that North Dakotans who want to work, that they'll have access to quality, affordable child care"
722,"  Along with the supports for businesses and affordable and reliable child care for families, our state must also offer the highest quality education, from preschool to college"
723, More than 48% of the state's $4
724,"9 billion general fund is dedicated to K-12, career and technical and higher education"
725," Teachers delivering that education deserve our gratitude and support for their dedication and commitment to our students, especially during these last two years"
726," With the proper resources, supports and efforts, these teachers will ensure that our students will be choice ready"
727," And by choice ready we mean they're ready for college, they're ready for a career, or they're ready for the military"
728, And they will have those choices
729, It's then up to our higher education institutions to focus on individual student needs while preparing the workforce for the high-demand careers in North Dakota
730,"  Our universities are making great progress, but we can't slow down"
731, We must increase certificate and student-centric programs
732, We must be better at aligning our degree offerings with the needs of North Dakota businesses
733,   And to assist in this effort I am pleased to announce that this week's North Dakota five community college presidents have signed a memorandum of understanding with Western Governors University to provide streamlined and seamless transfer to WGU's online college courses
734, North Dakota was one of the people that signed the original charter for Western Governors University
735," And the person that signed that is sitting right here in the front row,   former Governor Ed Schafer"
736, It was at a meeting 25 years ago
737," A concept came up that said, wow, there's going to be this new thing called online education, how can we be more competitive? WGU is one of the leaders in the nation in terms of the number and the breadth of the programs we provide"
738," It's time that we rekindle that partnership, enhance our offering for students of all ages"
739," Thank you, Ed Schafer, and thank you, WGU"
740,"  Our families, educators and businesses can't solve the workforce problem alone"
741," In previous addresses, I've noted that people are deciding where to live first and then find their career"
742," While this is still true, the pandemic has added a new element"
743, Now people can actually keep their current employers and work remotely and move to the community with the supports and the amenities that are best for their family
744," Virtually every major tech firm in the country has said, ""If you work for us, you can work from anywhere"
745,""" This is our chance to get kids that maybe left our state working for one of those big companies to come home"
746," But we have to have the amenities in the community, and we've got to have the child care, all of those things that are happening"
747,"  Meanwhile, back at home, we've got businesses that are, across the nation they're closing, businesses across our state are all limiting their business hours"
748," Have any of you gone anywhere to get a cup of coffee or buy something and not seen a ""help wanted"" sign? Businesses are literally begging for workers"
749," I mean, a small business owner told me yesterday that, hey, when you start spending your whole marketing budget on trying to hire people, there's something wrong with that model"
750,   And there is no silver bullet here
751, There's actions that we can take
752," And we have to stay focused on families, committed to supporting flexibility and automations we talked about, dedicated to quality education"
753, People will move to the states where there's great education
754, They will move to the place where they know they can get great child care
755,"  We have to remain steadfast on supporting families, and we've got to build and design communities that are differentiated"
756, We have to get private capital to go to existing infrastructure
757," We have to make the cities interesting, culturally and arts and everything else that's going on"
758, This is the way we keep our kids here and our grandkids here
759, But it's also the way we keep the grandparents here
760, We've got a lot of people retiring at 55 and moving to Florida and Arizona
761, It's not just keeping kids here
762, It's keeping everybody here
763,"   So other states can just sit back, do nothing, and they have in-migration"
764," We have to have in-migration exceed out-migration, because we constantly have young people and old people leaving"
765, So we've got work to do
766," Building communities with amenities, activities, recreation, places to gather"
767," Reinvent the public square as opposed to, hey, we're all just going to get and shout each other on online"
768, Get together in person
769," This way, North Dakota can compete with other states in the world for workforce"
770,"  Citizens and employers now demand access to these amenities as well, like arts and programs, culture events, and festivals"
771," We see this working in some of our communities, and those   communities are thriving"
772," Others around the state, when I travel to some of the smaller communities, they seem ready to accept what they've seen their whole life, which is decline in population, population moving away"
773, They seem ready to accept that
774, They're operating that somehow that they simply hope the community will be around for the next generation
775, We cannot rely just on hope
776, We can't just settle for the status quo
777,"  And here's an inspirational story of an individual, a North Dakotan who didn't rely on the status quo"
778, Maxum Mostad
779, He didn't
780, He was nine years old
781, He was from Langdon
782," He was an avid skier at Frost Fire near Walhalla in the beautiful northeast corner of the state, in the tree-covered Pembina Gorge"
783, His favorite thing was to be snowboarding
784, What did he hear two years ago? Maxum was concerned that Frost Fire may not be open for the season
785," So what did this fifth-grader do? He took matters in his own hands, opened a lemonade stand, held a bake sale, raised $3,000 to help ensure that Frost Fire could be open that year"
786,  He saw a problem
787, He found a solution
788, He took action
789, He took courage
790," He didn't let anybody tell him that no, this won't work"
791," He did it not only for himself, but he did it for the whole community and for everybody else that loves the sport"
792, Maxum and his family are here with us today
793," I want to say thank you, Maxum, having the vision, the caring, and building your community with your own two hands"
794, Let's give it up for Maxum
795," Way to go, guy"
796," Bet you were bummed when Shaun White didn't get gold, but we were all watching"
797,  ***  Communities today face challenges far beyond new amenities
798, Our society is in a behavioral health and addiction crisis
799," Overdose deaths nationally last year topping 100,000 annually"
800, This is the epidemic that was happening underneath the pandemic
801, It didn't go away
802," Our state is making progress on addressing this crisis through our great Department of Human Resources and the small, but mighty Recovery Reinvented team"
803," And while we're making great strides, there are still areas of our state where more help is needed"
804,"   Jonathan and Nicole Franklin of Harvey, North Dakota"
805, They know this all too well
806," After a game of pickup basketball at the local Armory, Jonathan was visiting with a group of high schools"
807, He realized that four of the parents of the kids that were there playing ball had died by suicide
808, These were people that he knew from his own school days in Harvey
809," No counseling center in town, Jonathan and Nicole, a licensed clinical social worker and a therapist, they took matters into their own hands"
810,  They purchased and rehabbed a vacant building on Harvey's main street
811, They launched the Mosaic Wellness Center
812, Now children and adults have somewhere local to go for counseling services
813, We're grateful to have such caring community members in our state
814," And while the Franklins’ story is unique, the need for more mental health and addiction services across North Dakota is not"
815, Behavioral health must continue to be a top priority
816, We've got to keep expanding critical behavioral health services
817," We've got to be reaching those in need sooner, and we've got to reach them closer to home"
818," And we've got to support telehealth as part of this   solution, including telehealth from providers that may not have a physical location in our state"
819," Collaborating with the legislature, the state has provided resources for schools to support behavioral health needs of students and to help prevent the tragedy of suicide"
820,  We've increased funding to improve access for addiction programs
821, We've expanded behavioral health crisis services to all regions of the state
822, And we've launched new recovery programs that include supportive housing
823, But there's more to be done
824," And we'll continue to meet these challenges through collaboration, through innovation and action"
825,"   One way we ask you to join us in this is to encourage you to save the date and join us for the next Recovery Reinvented, November 10th at Alerus Center in Grand Forks"
826," This last year, there was over 800 people in-person and close to 3,500 people watching online, including people watching from all of our corrections facilities across the state"
827,   Recovery Reinvented began with First Lady Kathryn bravely sharing her personal story of recovery
828," Five years later, Recovery Reinvented continues to inspire individuals across North Dakota and the nation to find hope in recovery, and to most importantly, eliminate the shame and stigma of addiction"
829,  Our great Human Services Behavioral Health team continues to drive program innovation that leads our nation
830," But this Saturday, February 19th is a very special day"
831," I'd like you all to join me in congratulating and thanking, for her courage and passion, for her living one day at a time as our first lady reaches her 20th year sobriety birthday, this Saturday"
832," Congratulations, Kathryn"
833," And that's harder than you think, staying sober and being married to me"
834," That's a hard thing to do, but congratulations"
835, Wow
836,"  ***  North Dakotans have always been dedicated to solving problems, creating communities that will support and inspire future generations"
837,"   We are innovators as North Dakotans, like Jake from Bushel, like Dorothy from Dot's"
838,"   We help each other, like Jonathan and Nicole supporting their neighbors and those children in Harvey and their need"
839,"   We help our neighbors, like the firefighters that we introduced earlier"
840,"   And we help our neighbors and even people we don't know, like the first lady courageously reducing stigma"
841,"   We're community builders as North Dakotans, like Maxum at Frost Fire, and like Nick Ybarra on the Maah Daah Hey Trail"
842,"     Positive, inspiring efforts like these are happening across our state every single day, countless selfless North Dakotans who are focused on creating and advancing solutions"
843, They believe in themselves
844, They believe in our youth
845, They believe in the goodness of their neighbors and their communities
846,"  But often today, these incredible selfless efforts fall under the radar"
847," They're drowned out by the noise of the angriest post on social media or the hottest trending ""outrage"" or ""be afraid"" story that may not even be relevant to North Dakota, may not even be true"
848, But that noise drowns out the goodness of North Dakotans
849,"   Nearly a century ago, Dr"
850, Henry J
851," Moore, he had a powerful, audacious vision to plant a massive garden right on the international border as the symbol of peace and friendship between the United States and Canada"
852," Last August, we continued the friendship and dedication to peace with an announcement of a $5 million legislative approved grant that was then matched by our Manitoba neighbors"
853, And we had a chance to celebrate that at the border with the premier of Manitoba
854, This July 14th will mark the 90th anniversary of the dedication of the Peace Garden
855," In 1932, some 50,000 people traveled from all over the two countries to celebrate that groundbreaking"
856," And if you saw that picture up there, you could see that they had a very good parking attendant at that event too"
857, I don't know if they kept the Canadian cars in Canada and the U
858,S
859, cars in the U
860,S
861,"   But we know that United States and Canada didn't agree on everything 90 years ago, and we still don't agree on everything today"
862, But we can learn a lesson from those efforts to focus on what unites versus focusing on what divides us
863,"  Edward Everett Hale, the 19th century author and historian, is credited with saying, ""Coming together is the beginning; Keeping together is progress; Working together is success"
864,"""   We can work together in North Dakota to overcome division"
865, We can work together to break through the noise
866, We can work together to attract new residents to our state
867, And we can work together to entice the youth and adults and grandparents alike to stay and build a better life here
868," We can work together to build relationships that aren't based on judging and labels and assumptions, but build relationships that are based on curiosity, on humility, on gaining understanding and mutual respect"
869,"  And we can do a better job, all of us, of telling our North Dakota story, that we have incredible opportunity"
870," And not just telling this story to outsiders that we're trying to move here to put value at it, but we got to tell a better story of telling it to our own children and grandchildren right here"
871, They are our state's future
872,"   The common thread that reflects our heritage, that reflects who we are as North Dakotans, is that we –  and this is what will differentiate us against all other places as we compete for this talent and capital"
873," If we're the state that puts our youth – and I'm talking child care, youth, pre-K, kids in school, college kids – when we put our youth, and then when we put our communities,   ahead of ourselves, we can create an amazing future"
874, That's happening right now in some communities in North Dakota
875,"  When we do this, we will keep growing stronger by the day, because that's what will represent our truly unshakable faith in the unlimited potential of North Dakota and its people"
876,   So let us leave here today and unite together
877, Let's unite with courage
878, Let's unite with gratitude
879," And let's do that in our spirit of Empowering People, Improving Lives and Inspiring Success"
880,   Thank you
881, God bless you all
882, God bless the Great State of North Dakota
883, God bless the United States of America

1," Speaker, Mr"
2," Pro Tem, Madam President, honored legislators, my fellow constitutional officers, Mr"
3," Chief Justice and members of the judiciary, my family, friends, and my fellow Idahoans"
4,   It’s good to deliver this speech back in the chambers
5," Last year I closed my State of the State address by saying, “In times of hardship, opportunity for growth emerges"
6,”  There’s no doubt the past couple of years have presented incredible challenges
7," Our frontline workers in healthcare, public safety, and education in particular have done an exceptional job"
8,"  Today, we have a few of these pandemic heroes here with us"
9," They are nurses, doctors, police officers, guardsmen, and teachers"
10, I would like to invite them to please stand up
11," Please, everyone, join me in recognizing them and their colleagues and thanking them for their service to our great state"
12,"  My friends, I stand before you today with great optimism and excitement about the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before us"
13,  Idaho’s economy is stronger than ever before
14,      We’re one of only four states with more jobs today than before the pandemic
15, Idahoans are working
16, We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country
17, Our budget is balanced
18, We have robust reserves
19, Idaho businesses and citizens benefit from living and working in the least regulated state in the nation
20,   Page 1 of 9 We’ve turned more money back to the citizens through historic tax relief and strategic investments in the areas that impact their daily lives
21,"  And for the second year in a row, we have yet another record budget surplus"
22,"   My friends, our success is no accident"
23,"  While other states liquidated their rainy-day funds and begged politicians in Washington, D"
24,C
25," for a bailout, together we rolled up our sleeves, made tough decisions, and led Idaho"
26,"  In Idaho, we manage government the same way families manage a household budget"
27, It is basic “kitchen table economics
28,"” It means facing tradeoffs head on, choosing to live within our means, saving for hard times, cutting waste, and stretching our dollars further"
29,   While D
30,C
31," is digging the country into a $29 trillion hole, Idaho has a record surplus of $1"
32,9 billion and counting
33,  While D
34,C
35," continues to crank out onerous new regulations, we took an axe to Idaho’s regulations for three straight years, and we continue to widen our lead as the least regulated state in the nation"
36," In fact, since I took office three years ago, we have cut or simplified 95-percent of Idaho regulations"
37," And now, through our Zero-Based Regulation initiative, this year we aim to cut or simplify another 20-percent of what remains, removing rocks from the shoes of small businesses"
38,  While D
39,C
40," wants to raise taxes on all citizens as Bidenflation surges, Idaho has put more money back into the people’s pockets"
41," Last year, together we cut income taxes and returned $450 million to all Idaho citizens and businesses"
42,"   It was called the biggest tax cut in state history, but I call it a good start"
43,"  While President Biden divides Americans in his attempts to elevate the role of government in citizens’ lives, coercing Americans with government-imposed vaccine mandates, Idaho says, “No"
44,”  Our lawsuits challenging Biden’s polarizing vaccine mandates are working
45,      I banned divisive “vaccine passports
46,” I never mandated masks or vaccines
47, We responded to a crisis with a balanced approach and kept Idaho open
48," And, while President Biden continues to dismiss the catastrophe at the U"
49,S
50,"-Mexico border, Idaho is banding together with other states to act"
51,"   Page 2 of 9 I traveled to the border last summer, where I saw for myself how Mexico drug cartels control access into our country! All because of President Biden’s flawed border policies"
52, This is completely unacceptable
53, Biden’s inaction has spawned a growing drug threat in our state
54, The vast majority of illicit drugs in Idaho are now sourced in Mexico
55,  Idaho families deserve better
56,"  Last summer, I sent a specialized team of Idaho State Troopers to Arizona to help fight the drug flow into our country and our state"
57," We sent our best to protect Americans and Idahoans from the drug cartels, and those troopers returned with new knowledge and training to help law enforcement here at home fight the drugs that have devastated so many lives"
58,  We have some of those troopers here with us today
59," Gentlemen, please stand so we can recognize you"
60,"  And now, I am asking for your support to deploy “Operation Esto Perpetua"
61,"” I will have more to share in the coming weeks, but “Operation Esto Perpetua” will bring together law enforcement and communities in new ways"
62,  We will continue to fight the consequences of our loose border and curb the smuggling of killer drugs such as fentanyl into our state from Mexico
63,"  Folks, we have been able to set the example of accountable, responsible government here in Idaho"
64, My family and Teresa’s have been in Idaho for generations
65, We want nothing more than for our grandchildren to stay settled in Idaho and enjoy their grandchildren here too
66,"  Teresa and I want the same for your grandchildren, too"
67,"  By now, you know my goal – for Idaho to be the place where we all can have the opportunity to thrive, where our children and grandchildren choose to stay, and for the ones who have left to choose to return"
68,  Think about someone you know who demonstrated true leadership
69," For me, my father, David Little, Teresa’s father, Phil Soulen, and an old friend, Louise Shadduck, come to mind"
70,   Here’s what I’ve learned from them
71,        Leaders give people confidence and show the way through humble strength
72, Leaders go through life with a spirit of service
73, Leaders listen
74," The voice of a leader is effective, not just loud"
75, Page 3 of 9 Every day I endeavor to live up to the example of my mentors
76," That is what the people of Idaho deserve from their Governor, and it is what they deserve from all those elected to public office"
77,  I have a plan for Idaho – a path to give back our record budget surplus to Idahoans through continued tax relief and strategic investments where they make the biggest difference in their daily lives
78,  My plan is called LEADING IDAHO
79,   My plan is rooted in a longstanding conservative principle – fiscal discipline
80," For the first time in state history, Idaho was upgraded to a Triple-A credit rating"
81," It is an achievement that will save taxpayer dollars and, importantly, reflects our dedication to conservative, responsible budgeting"
82,  Earlier today I delivered a budget that is balanced and holds the line on spending
83,"   My budget pays off state building debt, saving taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in interest payments"
84,  My budget also puts us on a path to pay off all known deferred maintenance needs – those backlogged repairs needed in our infrastructure – over the next ten years
85,"  And my budget bolsters our rainy-day funds to a record level, putting more than $1 billion in the bank to guard against future downturns"
86,  We must be even more vigilant in perceived times of plenty to make decisions that are prudent and will withstand the test of time
87," We did not spend our way to a surplus, and budget surpluses must never become an excuse for wasteful spending"
88,   There’s no better feeling than giving back to hardworking Idahoans more of what they earned
89,"   To date, in my first term, we have cut nearly $1 billion in taxes"
90,   Let me repeat that
91," Together, we have given back nearly $1 billion to Idahoans through income tax relief, property tax relief, and relief from unemployment taxes on Idaho businesses"
92,"   And today, I am proposing we double down on our efforts"
93,  I propose we return more than $1 billion in income tax relief to Idaho taxpayers over the next five years!   Page 4 of 9 And let’s not wait
94," Right now, Idaho families are forced to pay more for food, gas, and everyday goods as inflation swells under Biden’s watch"
95," Poor handling of the economy, oppressive regulations, and a bloated federal budget have all contributed to inflation rates we have not seen in 40 years"
96,"   With Bidenflation exploding, let’s immediately pass $600 million in income tax relief that we can get back into the wallets of all Idahoans this spring!  I propose $350 million in immediate rebates and $250 million in ongoing income tax relief, allowing working families to keep more of what they earned and free them from the penalty of living with historic inflation"
97,   We cannot delay in deploying this investment in working families
98,"   We must also support Idaho’s small businesses, the backbone of our economy"
99,"  Last year, we strengthened our unemployment insurance trust fund, making it one of the most solvent funds in the country"
100, Doing so led to a $200 million tax cut for Idaho businesses
101,"  I propose we lock in these lower rates for the next two years, saving Idaho businesses $64 million so they can continue creating good Idaho jobs"
102,"  Some say we shouldn’t cut taxes, that we have to choose between cutting taxes and meeting important needs within our state"
103,  This is false
104,   My budget shows we can do both
105," We can spend less than we bring in, offer tax relief, and fund the top priorities – education and infrastructure"
106,"   More than 130 years ago, the founders of our state in writing the Idaho Constitution recognized the stability and endurance of our republican form of government depends mainly on “the intelligence of the people"
107,”   A person’s education starts in the home
108," Parents are in the drivers’ seat, as they should be and always will be in Idaho"
109,  The children today will become the workforce of tomorrow
110," They will be the engineers, loggers, doctors, farmers, construction workers, entrepreneurs, teachers, truckers, you name it"
111, We want our Idaho students to receive a strong foundation of learning now so they can stay here and make our state strong for future generations
112,  And Idaho schools partner with parents in the education of their children
113,"   Page 5 of 9 That’s why I propose making the largest investment in Idaho education, ever"
114,   My budget adds $1
115,1 billion over the next five years to improve Idaho education
116,   And it all starts with literacy
117," Today, I propose adding $47 million in ongoing funding to literacy programs – to build on the reading success that parents instill at home"
118," Local school districts across Idaho, with input from families, will decide how best to deploy the resources"
119,  Literacy has been my top priority because it just makes sense
120, Our investments in education later on will have more impact if we can work with families to get more students to read proficiently early on
121,  Adding these investments now will increase state literacy funding five-fold since I took office just three years ago
122,  I cannot think of a more “back to basics” investment that will make a meaningful difference in students’ lives today and for years to come
123,  The key to strong schools is parental involvement
124," Our system of public education in Idaho is locally driven, and the system works best when parents and families engage"
125,"  Parents partner with teachers in the education of their children, and we cannot meet our commitment to our students without supporting the people who teach them in the classroom"
126,"  If you’re running a business, you know you can only attract and retain dedicated, quality workers by paying them competitively, offering good benefits, and making them feel valued"
127,  Our educator workforce is no different
128,   My budget invests in these partners – our teachers – which ultimately serves Idaho families
129,  The pandemic pushed many parents toward new ways of meeting the educational needs of their children
130," Last year, we served 18,000 Idaho families and 46,000 students with grants to help cover educational needs outside the classroom"
131,"  And now, to build on our success, I am proposing $50 million for the new Empowering Parents grants"
132," The grants will cover things such as computers, tutoring, internet connectivity and other needs so students have the best chance for success"
133,"   The Empowering Parents grants put families in control of their child’s education, as it should be"
134,"   Page 6 of 9 My Leading Idaho plan also makes other key investments to support law enforcement, our veterans, our valued members of the Idaho National Guard, and safe and secure elections"
135,  I want to add more than $60 million to address needs within the Idaho State Police
136, Idaho is a state that openly values its police officers
137," While others seek to “defund the police,” Idaho DEFENDS the police"
138, Idaho truly is a state that “backs the blue
139,”  I also propose we make the biggest investment ever in our State Veterans Homes - $75 million – to give our veterans better quality of life and improve services for them
140," Our veterans have done so much for us, and they deserve it"
141,  I also want to invest in the soldiers and airmen of the Idaho National Guard
142," My plan doubles our investment in scholarships for Guardsmen, which boosts our efforts to get more Idahoans to sign up for the Guard"
143," Military service has always been and always will be one of the most honorable ways for a person to serve their community, state, and country"
144, We are so grateful to our Guardsmen and all military service members and veterans for all they have done and continue to do to promote freedom and peace in our country
145,  We can honor the sacrifice of our military heroes by doing our part to make America as strong as possible – and we all know free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy
146,   We’re very fortunate to live in Idaho where our elections are free of fraud
147, But there is more we can do to elevate Idahoans’ trust in their elections
148,"  Last year, I established my Cybersecurity Task Force to come up with new ways to protect Idaho from cyber-attacks and bolster election integrity"
149, My Leading Idaho plan implements recommendations from the task force
150,"  I am proposing $12 million to establish the new Cyber Response and Defense Fund to ensure the state is prepared to respond to any cyber-attack from bad actors in China, Russia, or elsewhere"
151,  I’m also pushing for proactive integrity audits to enhance transparency and confidence in our elections here in Idaho
152,"  We must make election integrity a priority, to give our citizens confidence that their vote matters"
153,  Idaho has a strong track record of giving back through tax relief and by making significant investments in the areas that impact Idahoans’ daily lives the most
154,"  Things like… clean and plentiful water for a strong agricultural sector; improved broadband access; increased medical capacity to support a healthy Idaho and our healthcare heroes; better access to outdoor recreation and improved land and fire management; and better  Page 7 of 9 opportunities through investments in career technical education, colleges, workforce development and housing, and childcare"
155,  The list goes on and on
156, My Leading Idaho plan will continue to invest in all of these important areas and many others
157,  Protecting Idahoans of all ages from the afflictions of mental illness and addiction led to the creation of the three-branch Behavioral Health Council in 2020
158, It was a step that is now helping Idaho families access the services they need when they need it most
159,"   Behavioral health issues affect Idaho’s corrections system, judicial system, hospitals, local communities, and schools"
160,"   Today, we are joined by Krista Gneiting, the brave teacher who confronted and disarmed a 12-year-old girl at school last May in Rigby"
161," Krista calmly took the gun away from a little girl in crisis, and then held her in her arms until police arrived"
162,"  Krista, please stand so we can recognize you for protecting everyone in the building that day and for your compassion with that sixth-grade girl"
163,"  As I know Krista can attest, there is a strong connection between safe communities and access to behavioral health resources for Idahoans of all ages"
164,"  Today, I am proposing we accelerate the implementation of the Behavioral Health Council’s recommendations by investing $50 million to improve behavioral healthcare across Idaho"
165," It is one step of many we will take to help prevent tragedy, improve lives, and make our communities safer"
166,  Another area where we are making real progress to improve safety is the time Idahoans spend on the road
167,"  Last year, together we passed the largest transportation funding package in state history"
168," Our sustainable transportation funding solution added historic amounts for new infrastructure to improve safety and ease congestion, giving all Idahoans more precious time with their families"
169,  And we did it without raising taxes
170, But we cannot stop there
171,"   The continued prosperity of our farmers, ranchers, and the folks who work in the woods depends on a safe, efficient system of roads and bridges"
172,  We cannot continue our record economic trajectory if our logging trucks can’t get across old bridges or we can’t get our farm products to market
173,   Page 8 of 9 My budget invests another $200 million in ongoing funding to fully address our known maintenance needs locally and statewide
174, I also propose we invest another $200 million in one-time funding to clear out one-third of the backlog of deficient bridges
175,    We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fully fund known needs – to maintain our roads and bridges permanently – with no new taxes
176,  I am unwilling to put the safety of Idahoans and the maintenance of our state’s roads and bridges at the whims of the feds
177," We must not look to Washington, D"
178,C
179, to solve our problems
180, Leading Idaho means addressing our own state’s needs
181," Together, we’ll show Washington, D"
182,C
183,", how to tackle transportation – by fully funding known gaps with no new taxes and providing long-term funding for long-term needs"
184,"  Ladies and gentlemen, the challenges of the past two years for many, including myself, have driven us to more frequent prayer and a closer relationship with our creator"
185,  And out of the hardships we have strengthened
186, We have kept things headed in the right direction
187,  We won’t spoil the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity before us to give the people back their hard-earned dollars through tax relief and make historic investments where they matter most
188,  We will stay focused on LEADING IDAHO
189,  I want to thank my family for their unwavering support
190, Family is the nucleus of all that is important in life
191, And our First Lady – her good heart is a source of strength and peace for our family and the entire state
192,   And I want to thank YOU – the people of Idaho – for Idaho’s success
193, You have proven you will always stand up for the strength and prosperity of our great state
194,  Thank you and God bless

13," My wonderful wife and partner, First Lady Sarah Stitt"
14, Thank you so much to my family for being here today
15,  It means a lot
16," And most importantly, my fellow Oklahomans"
17, I’m honored to stand before you today and begin my fourth year as your governor
18, It has been a great privilege to lead our state
19,  I am thankful to the citizens of Oklahoma and my heavenly Father for giving me this opportunity
20, Mr
21," Speaker, Mr"
22," Pro Tem, members of the House and Senate, last year, we showed Oklahomans what's possible when we work together"
23, We cut taxes for all Oklahomans
24, We made record investments in education and gave parents more choices
25, We grew our economy
26," We modernized our government, and we stood up to defend the rights of Oklahomans -- including protecting the lives of our unborn children! Today, I am proud to say we are well-positioned to continue our momentum toward becoming a Top Ten state"
27,  1 Full text version I want to praise my colleagues in the Legislature for being fiscally conservative and responsible with taxpayer dollars
28," In the face of criticism, we stayed the course"
29, We made smart decisions instead of going on a spending spree
30," It’s a different story in Washington, D"
31,C
32,", and so are the results"
33, Our national economy is struggling
34, Inflation is at a forty-year high
35, Gas and groceries are more expensive
36, Supply chain issues have made everything harder to find
37," But if you live in Oklahoma, it’s a different story"
38," While other states are shutting down their economies, we’ve never been more open for business"
39," In fact, 40,000 more Oklahomans have jobs today compared to when I took office"
40," As unemployment skyrocketed in some parts of the country, ours is down to just 2"
41,3%
42,"  That’s the lowest it’s been in our state’s history! Across the country, huge numbers of Americans are moving to states that value freedom and trust their citizens to make choices for themselves"
43, There has never been a bigger difference between a red state and a blue state
44, Freedom-loving Americans cannot escape liberal lockdown states fast enough
45," Since April 2020, more than 27,000 of them have moved to Oklahoma"
46," That includes Jonathan and Erica, who moved here from Seattle because they believe in freedom and personal responsibility"
47," Can you imagine leaving a place like Norman, Oklahoma for Southern California? I mean, who would do that? Oklahoma, I’m proud of the progress we’ve made in just three short years"
48," But today, the state of our state is at a crossroads"
49, We have a choice between two paths
50,  One path leads toward a Top Ten State
51,"  2 Full text version It’s a familiar road, and it’s paved with unity, fairness, and equal protection under the law"
52, The other path leads to a jigsaw puzzle of jurisdiction
53," From the beginning, I’ve sounded the alarm on the Supreme Court’s McGirt decision"
54," Because I knew then, and I know now, that even a narrow Supreme Court ruling can fundamentally change a state"
55, Oklahoma has been robbed of the authority to prosecute crimes
56," Put simply, McGirt jeopardizes justice"
57," Over the past year, we’ve done everything we can to protect law and order and limit the impacts of this decision"
58," Our broad coalition includes Attorney General John O’Connor; all 27 district attorneys across the state, especially Steve Kunzweiler in Tulsa County and Matt Ballard in Craig, Mayes and Rogers Counties; Police Chiefs like Wendell Franklin in Tulsa, the Oklahoma Sheriffs’ Association; the Oklahoma Farm Bureau; the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association; environmentalists; The Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, and city leaders"
59," Recently, we’ve won two major victories to protect law and order"
60," First, the Supreme Court agreed McGirt is not retroactive"
61, This means that convicted criminals stay in prison
62,  The Supreme Court also agreed to hear another case
63, A win in that case would let the state go back to enforcing law and order and protecting more crime victims in Eastern Oklahoma
64, That’s the way we’ve done it since 1907
65," The new rules put the federal government in charge, and it isn’t working"
66," In 2013, a 12-year-old boy named Billy Lord was riding his bike in Wagoner"
67, Richard Roth was driving drunk and hit Billy and killed him
68,  The state convicted Roth for Billy’s death and sentenced him to prison
69, But Mr
70," Roth is white, and since Billy was Cherokee, the guilty verdict was overturned"
71," The case can’t be retried in federal court, and Roth could go free from punishment without even so much as a traffic ticket on his record"
72, That’s not fair
73, And it’s not equal protection under the law
74," Billy’s mom, Pamela, is here today"
75,"  3 Full text version She told the court that while her son was a tribal member, he was also a citizen of the United States and the state of Oklahoma"
76, She said allowing the man who killed her son to walk free is an insult to Billy’s memory and an insult to justice
77," Pamela, I’m sorry for your loss"
78, I’m fighting for justice for Billy
79," Surely, we can all agree that no crime should go unpunished"
80, Billy deserves justice
81, All victims deserve justice
82," Oklahoma, here’s the deal"
83, This isn’t about winning and losing
84, This isn’t personal
85, It’s not Kevin Stitt versus the tribes
86," Instead, it’s about certainty"
87, It’s about law and order
88," It’s about fairness, equal protection under the law, and one set of rules"
89, We’re all Oklahomans
90, Let’s work together to solve this
91," With that, let me turn to our legislative agenda for this session"
92, We start this year with an incredible opportunity
93, Oklahomans have elected the largest supermajority in state history
94, We have a very clear mandate to enact strong conservative policies that protect liberty and defend against the Biden administration’s federal overreach! I challenge each of us to be bold
95, Let’s capitalize on the opportunity we have and make Oklahoma a Top Ten state
96," To reach our destination, we need a map to stay on course"
97," Our road to Top Ten has four checkpoints: Driving hope for all Oklahomans, protecting Oklahomans and our way of life, making Oklahoma the most business friendly state in the country and delivering taxpayers more for their money"
98, Let’s start with driving hope for all Oklahomans
99, Hope is not a wish or a feeling
100, It’s a proven science that can be measured and applied
101," More than 2,000 studies have shown that hope is the greatest predictor of success"
102," That applies to education, work, health, mental health, social relationships, family and trauma recovery"
103, Hope impacts everything that matters to us
104," I want to take a moment to recognize the First Lady, my wife, Sarah Stitt"
105,  4 Full text version She’s created the Sarah Stitt Hope Foundation to bring the science of hope to communities across Oklahoma
106," Over the next two years, we’re training every state employee how to apply the science of hope to their agencies"
107,"   Sarah, thank you so much for your hard work"
108, We can drive hope for all Oklahomans through education
109," Throughout my time as governor, I’ve committed to putting our students first"
110,"  Across the country, parents are waking up to the learning loss caused by closed classrooms"
111, They’re demanding better for their kids
112," I’m proud that Secretary of Education Ryan Walters and I have been fighting to put our students first and keep our schools open longer than anyone in the country! In Oklahoma, we listen to parents, because we know God gave kids to parents – not the government! We expanded the equal opportunity scholarship to provide more choices for low and middle-income families"
113, That helps students like Jonathan Wright
114, He’s a freshman at Oklahoma Bible Academy in Enid
115," When Jonathan was three years old, he was adopted out of foster care by a single mom named Lisa"
116, Jonathan has used the Equal Opportunity Scholarship to go to Oklahoma Bible for four years
117, His mom said the mentors and positive role models at his school have transformed his life
118, Jonathan and Lisa are here today
119," Would you please stand and be recognized? We provided record funding for all public schools, including charter and rural schools"
120," These initial investments were good first steps for Oklahoma’s education turnaround, but there’s much more to do"
121," Just 15% of Oklahoma high school graduates are ready for college in English, math, reading and science -- less than one out of five"
122, We can do better than 47th in the nation when it comes to our kids
123, We’ve tiptoed around the edges for far too long
124,  It’s clear the status quo isn’t working
125, We need to take bold steps
126," It will take courage, and it will take a desire to make a generational impact"
127," This is our moment! We know education is not one-size-fits-all, and I pledge to support any legislation that gives parents more school choice, because in Oklahoma, we need to fund students, not systems!  5 Full text version Pro Tem Treat filed a bill called the Oklahoma Empowerment Act"
128," It makes sure that money follows the student, and it would make us a national leader in school choice"
129," Let me be clear: Oklahoma has a lot of great schools, but the results don’t lie"
130," We need new ideas, more options, and higher standards for our kids"
131, This is just common sense
132,  We have a duty to make sure nothing stands in the way of an Oklahoma student achieving their full potential
133, There are roadblocks – literally
134, State law creates artificial barriers for school districts that don’t put our students first
135,   Our school transportation formula is outdated and broken
136, We desperately need to modernize it
137, Another roadblock in our current system keeps some of the best teachers out of the classroom
138," Right now, some talented teachers choose to leave the classroom to make more money as an administrator"
139, Oklahoma students can’t be the best without the best teachers
140, That’s why I’m proposing matching funds so that our best teachers can make six figure salaries and stay in the classroom
141, It’s the right thing to do for our teachers and for our kids! Another way to support Oklahoma educators is to protect their paychecks from union bosses
142, The same unions that have pushed critical race theory and school closures intimidate new teachers into handing over part of their salaries
143, Liberal unions want to keep a stranglehold on their cut of teacher pay
144, Enough is enough! Every other profession lets you opt-in to health insurance and other benefits at work every year
145," Unions should be opt-in, not opt-out! The second checkpoint on our road to Top Ten is protecting Oklahomans and our way of life"
146," As elected officials, this is one of our most important duties"
147, We can’t do that if we don’t focus on securing fairness and safety in the Medical Marijuana industry
148," To the citizens of rural Oklahoma, I hear you"
149," This is causing major problems in our communities, and we must get it under control"
150,"  6 Full text version When Oklahomans voted for Medical Marijuana, they were sold a bill of goods"
151," The state question was misleading, and it has tied our hands as we regulate the industry"
152," Because of that state question, Oklahoma charges just $2500 for a commercial license"
153," Even California charges up to $181,000 – 72 times more! As a result, we have 7 times the growers than California with just 10% of the people"
154," Next door in Arkansas, they have 8 growers"
155," We have 8,300"
156, You know as well as I do that not all of that product is being sold legally
157," This is a perfect example why we need to make sure initiative petitions represent Oklahomans, not out-of-state special interest groups"
158, Oklahomans deserve to know the details before voting to change our constitution
159," While we can’t change the past, we can learn from it and improve our future"
160, We are getting the right leaders in place and untying their hands to enforce the laws
161,  I’ve directed our law enforcement to crack down hard on the black market
162, Agents have been in the field making arrests
163," Let me be clear: drug cartels, organized crime and foreign bad actors have no place in Oklahoma"
164," We will find them, and we will bring them to justice! Oklahoma is a proud law and order state"
165," As other states and cities are still defunding their police, we have a chance to stand apart"
166, Brave men and women who put their lives on the line deserve leaders who will have their back
167, Now is the time to transform and modernize our state law enforcement system into the nation’s best
168," To do this, we need to tackle four critical areas: the recruitment, retention, health and training of our troopers, agents and investigators"
169," First, we must protect our officers"
170,  Mental health does not discriminate
171, Depression and suicide do not discriminate
172," It’s long overdue, but this year we must prioritize the health of our officers and  create the Oklahoma First Responders Wellness Division"
173, Its foundation is a peer to peer system designed to recognize the early signs of trauma and give immediate help to officers who need it
174, This could have saved Ronald Hook
175,   7 Full text version The continued trauma he experienced as an officer seemingly went unnoticed and unaddressed
176,"  After 15 years of dedicated service in law enforcement, this family man, husband, father and friend, tragically ended his life"
177,"  Ron’s daughter Alisha, and his sisters, Sissy and Suzy, are here today"
178, They support creating this wellness division so other officers and their families won’t experience the same tragedy
179,"  Alisha, Sissy and Suzy, I am so sorry for the loss of your dad and brother"
180, Thank you for being here
181," In the same way we can attract and support teachers, we need to provide law enforcement officers competitive pay, the best training available, and more career options"
182, I’m requesting that we pool our resources and build a joint statewide training facility
183, Officers put their lives on the line every single day
184, The least we could do in return is provide them with the highest quality training
185," Our state’s law enforcement also desperately needs a consolidated, unified command structure within a single department"
186, 43 other states have this
187, Oklahoma should be no different
188, A unified command will create the career growth opportunities that today’s recruits expect
189, I want to pause here and thank each one of our brave men and women in law enforcement who sacrifice each day to keep our communities safe
190," Other states may turn their backs on the blue, but as governor, I will always stand with those who protect and hold that thin blue line"
191, Our third Top Ten checkpoint is making Oklahoma the most business-friendly state in the nation
192, Last year’s pro-business policies are already paying dividends
193," Canoo, an electric vehicle manufacturer, is a perfect example"
194," Last summer, Canoo announced it will open a factory in Pryor next year and bring 2,000 jobs to Oklahoma"
195," Canoo’s CEO, Tony Aquila, said he chose Oklahoma because he wants to be where the puck is going – not where it’s been"
196," Since Canoo’s initial announcement, it’s added a technology hub, software development, customer support and financing centers to Oklahoma"
197, That’s at least 700 more high-paying jobs for our state
198, Tony Aquila is here in the gallery today
199,"  8 Full text version Tony, thank you for believing in Oklahoma"
200, And for helping to pioneer the future of our state’s economy
201, Canoo is just one company that has seen the benefit of Oklahoma being open for business
202," Thanks to the Governor’s Closing Fund and the Legislature’s investment in business development, the Department of Commerce is coming off its best year ever"
203," Secretary of Commerce and Workforce Development Scott Mueller and his team are working hundreds of opportunities, thousands of jobs, and billions of dollars invested in our economy"
204, But “open for business” isn’t just about recruiting new companies
205,  We’ve launched an innovative platform to help Oklahoma manufacturers solve supply chain issues
206, Our system connects them to buyers and sellers and keeps their money in Oklahoma
207, More than 400 companies are already signed up
208," We are delivering on creating jobs and growing our economy, but we are at a critical junction when it comes to our state’s workforce"
209," Across the nation and here in our state, businesses are struggling to find the employees they need"
210," We need more nurses, more teachers, more engineers"
211, Tinker Air Force base is rapidly expanding
212," I met with the Secretary of the Air Force at the Pentagon because we expect to add 6-10,000 jobs there in the next five years"
213, Our state’s workforce needs to grow at the same pace as our businesses
214, That means we have to be bold
215, Our entire education system must be aligned and motivated to meet this challenge head on
216," Let’s tear down the silos between K-12, Career Techs and Higher Ed to train the next generation"
217, Every student needs to be college ready or career ready
218, I know we can do it
219, The road to success looks different for every Oklahoman
220," We’re all made in God’s image, and He has a unique plan for each of our lives"
221, That’s why we have to provide career paths to match the skills of our students with the jobs in our communities
222, Let’s increase apprenticeships in high school and pathways to jobs that don’t require a college degree
223,   9 Full text version Let’s align and leverage our system to train every Oklahoman with the skills they need to provide for their family
224," In the middle of a nursing shortage, our universities can’t be turning away qualified applicants like they are now"
225," Instead, we need to reward universities for producing graduates in critical areas"
226, Our state depends on it
227," Last year, while states like New York were billions of dollars in the hole, we cut taxes for every single Oklahoman"
228," We took care of the 300,000 working families being hit the hardest by increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit"
229," We can, and we should, do more for Oklahoma families"
230,  That’s why I’m proposing to eliminate the grocery tax
231," Oklahoma is one of just 13 states that taxes groceries, and ours is one of the highest"
232, Many Oklahomans are already struggling under the weight of record inflation
233, Let’s give them more help this year
234," Because, after all, we need more taxpayers, not more taxes"
235, States across the country are continuing to cut taxes on their citizens
236,   Nine states don’t charge a personal income tax
237," Many others are racing to join them, and we can’t be left behind"
238, My vision is to create a taxpayer protection plan that responsibly lowers income taxes according to our state revenue
239, Cutting taxes based on how our economy grows ensures we’ll always have money to pay for core services like education and roads and bridges
240,"As our economy grows, Oklahomans share in our success by keeping more of their hard-earned money"
241, I look forward to working with the Legislature to modernize our tax code this session
242, Another way to do that is to get rid of the income tax on military retirement benefits
243," Our military installations are so important to our state, and we want to keep our retired veterans here in Oklahoma"
244, It’s a commonsense way to support those who defend our freedoms
245, Let’s get it done
246," The fourth, and final, checkpoint on the road to Top Ten is delivering taxpayers more for their money"
247,"  10 Full text version This requires strategic investments in modernizing government agencies, transparency, building our savings account, and infrastructure"
248, Oklahomans hired me as Governor because they wanted their government to run more like a business
249," From day one, I’ve challenged my agency heads to deliver taxpayers more for their money"
250," We’re doing it by making agencies more effective and responsive to our citizens, not by growing government"
251," We have 2,000 fewer state employees than just a few years ago, and we’ve invested into technology to provide better results"
252," In May, we’ll launch a unified, cutting-edge human resources system for all state agencies for the first time in history"
253," In the past year, too many Oklahomans had to wait too long to get a driver’s license"
254, Basic services that should have taken a few minutes were taking days or even months
255, This is unacceptable
256, We can’t let it happen again
257, That’s why I’m calling for the Legislature to partner with me to make it easier than ever for Oklahomans to interact with state government
258," Let’s start with drivers’ licenses and vehicle registration, because that’s something we can all agree needs to be fixed"
259, There’s not a business in the world that measures success based on how much it spends
260, Government should be no different
261," I want to thank this Legislature for its commitment to transparency, especially in education"
262," Last year, I worked with 22 state lawmakers to request the first-ever comprehensive audit of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, because tax dollars belong in the classrooms, not in the pockets of bureaucrats! There are no rubber stamps and blank checks on my watch"
263, That’s why we’re launching a new budgeting process for our agencies
264, It’s called Transparent Oklahoma Performance
265, You can track our progress online at top
266,ok
267,gov
268, I will keep shining a light to protect the taxpayers and hold our government accountable! I want to also applaud the Legislature for prioritizing saving over spending
269," Today, we have the largest savings account in state history at over $2 billion! This year, I’m asking the Legislature to raise the cap on our savings account to continue protecting our future"
270,    11 Full text version This would give us financial security and the ability to make strategic investments like never before
271, One of the ways we can make a generational impact is by investing in infrastructure
272, Secretary of Transportation Tim Gatz has taken this challenge head on
273," Across the state, we’re improving pavement and safety on urban and rural highways"
274, We’ve made it to Top Ten in bridges
275, A major project at I-235 and I-44 in Oklahoma City is almost finished
276," We’ve made great progress, but more can be done"
277, The future of our economy will depend on having a modern highway system that manages congestion and has reliable travel times
278, Let’s be bold
279, I’m calling to invest $13 billion in transportation over the next 10 years
280, This will let us close the loops around Oklahoma City and Tulsa
281, We’ll widen the Turner to 6 lanes the entire way
282, We’ll expand the Will Rogers in Northeast Oklahoma and parts of the Kilpatrick in Oklahoma City
283, We’re also adding more access points for communities along our system
284, This will make travel easier and lead to more economic development across the state
285, Here’s an example: the Kickapoo Turnpike has been open east of Oklahoma City for a year now
286, It’s created an economic explosion for the city of Harrah
287," In the last year, more than 2,200 new homes have started construction"
288," Harrah’s first hotel opened in November, and the city estimates its population will almost double in three or four years"
289, We have an opportunity to bring that kind of growth to more cities across our state
290, We’ll announce more details – including drone corridors and emerging mobility -- later this month
291, This is our moment to make Oklahoma’s transportation system the best in the nation! Infrastructure is not the only place we can make a generational impact
292, The opportunities this year are endless
293," Will we prioritize special interests or the people we serve? Will we prioritize the next generation or the next election? Now is the time for big, bold decisions"
294, Let’s leave a legacy for generations
295,"  As I begin the final year of my first term as governor, let’s look back at the progress we’ve made"
296," When my administration took office, Oklahoma was coming off two years of revenue failures"
297,"  12 Full text version We had almost no money in savings, which meant budget cuts were an annual challenge"
298," State agencies reported to unelected bureaucrats, and they weren’t being held accountable"
299, It was so out of control that the Department of Corrections wanted a billion dollar budget increase!  Our state was reeling from a teacher walkout
300," And on a personal level, I felt our state lacked the confidence and pride I saw in other parts of the country"
301," Because of our great work together, Oklahoma’s turnaround is well underway"
302, Our fiscal house is in order
303, We’re coming off a year where we made record investments in education while still cutting taxes
304, We’re fourth in the nation in budget reserves
305, Our state’s credit rating has gone up
306, We’ve held state agencies accountable by putting the right leaders in place and aligning them with a common vision
307, Oklahomans have a renewed sense of pride in our state and our way of life
308," Thousands of people across the country have said, “sign me up!” But to get to Top Ten, we can’t be satisfied with the status quo"
309," Jim Collins wrote in his book Good to Great, “good is the enemy of great"
310,”  Will Rogers put it another way: “the road to success is dotted with many tempting parking spaces
311,"” Oklahoma has all the bones and the capabilities to be the greatest state in the nation, and we’ve come too far to settle for anything less than our best"
312, We must never lose sight of the fact that Oklahomans elected us as leaders
313, They sent us here to protect their rights and to make sure everyone in our state has equal opportunity to succeed
314," Just because your life is fine, or your school is great, or your business is thriving, doesn’t mean we don’t have an obligation to make sure everyone has that same chance"
315," We’re all here because we have a higher calling to do what’s right, not what’s easy"
316," I truly believe Oklahoma can be, and will be, a Top Ten state"
317," Let’s work together, and let’s get it done"
318,"  13 Full text version I’m so proud to be an American, but I thank God every day that I’m an Oklahoman! God bless you"

64, We made historicinvestments in education

84,"And through our Employer Training Grant program, 3,700 employers have trained more than 41,000 Hoosiers,and they achieved an average pay raise of over $4,000 a year"
85,All these programs give Indiana a leg up in growing our businesses and bringing in new ones

1," Parson Office of Communications  1  2022 STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS – Strong Today, Stronger Tomorrow GOVERNOR MIKE PARSON  January 19, 2022 3:00 PM (CST)  Thank you Lieutenant Governor, Mr"
2," Speaker, statewide officials, Judges of the Missouri Supreme Court, and state legislators"
3, It is an honor again to stand before you today as the 57th Governor of the Great State of Missouri
4,"  Once again, we are at an exciting time for Missouri and our future"
5, This past year we celebrated the bicentennial of our state and 150 years of the Missouri Governor’s Mansion
6,  And I am honored to have served as Missouri’s Governor during this remarkable milestone for our state
7,  The First Lady and I were fortunate to be able to tour Missouri and visit communities all across the state and witness their individual contributions to our rich history
8, From the Ulysses S
9, Grant National Historic Site in St
10, Louis to the Hubble Space Telescope in Marshfield…from Walt Disney in Marceline to Jesse James’ birthplace in Kearney…from John J
11," Pershing in Laclede to Mark Twain in Hannibal… AND how could we ever forget Maxie the Goose in small town Sumner, Missouri… After more than 45 Bicentennial stops, the First Lady and I count ourselves blessed to have experienced the history, tradition, and heart and soul of what makes Missouri great"
12," Faith, family, neighbors helping neighbors… that’s who Missourians are"
13, AND that’s what makes Missouri the best state in the United States
14,  We were also able to host the Bicentennial Parade and Inaugural Ball that was enjoyed and celebrated by Missourians from all over our state
15,"  Our historic parade included over 100 entries that proudly showcased communities all across Missouri… Including the Lincoln University Marching Musical Storm, the Budweiser Clydesdales, Chinese Dragon Dancers, and the Negro League Baseball Museum"
16,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
17, Parson Office of Communications  2  It marked the first time in our state’s history that an Inaugural Ball was held outside
18," And we counted ourselves fortunate to be able to celebrate with thousands of Missourians, many of which had never experienced an Inaugural Ball"
19,  BUT none of this would have been possible without the efforts state government undertook to lessen the impacts of COVID-19
20,"  When I stood before you last year, our limited supply of COVID-19 vaccines were available for only a small group of Missourians"
21,"  No one had a roadmap or a playbook, and we knew we faced difficult times ahead"
22,"  Nevertheless, state government accepted the challenges and prevailed by focusing on fairness in our vaccine distribution efforts"
23,"  While there will always be endless critics to tell us how we could have done it better, the facts are we were the ones in the arena"
24,  We made the tough decisions and NEVER cowered to the challenge
25,"  Today, one of our greatest successes is in the fact that more than 94 percent of Missourians 65 and older, our most vulnerable population, have received protection from this virus"
26,  AND nearly 75 percent of Missourians 18 and older have received a vaccine
27,"  Now, while we have room to improve and encourage all Missourians to consider vaccination… We have worked tirelessly to ensure that vaccines are available to every Missourian that wants one"
28,"  And we couldn’t have done it without the dedicated public servants at the Department of Health and Senior Services; State Emergency Management Agency; the Missouri National Guard; Department of Public Safety; doctors, nurses, and health care professionals; and the thousands of local partners, for their bold and heroic actions throughout the pandemic"
29,"  Joining us today, are individuals we would like to give a special thanks to… Michael McMillan and James Clark with the Urban League in St"
30," Louis and Pastor Miles and Janet Miles-Bartee with Morning Star Baptist Church in Kansas City, were instrumental in helping vaccinate some of our most vulnerable populations"
31,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
32," Parson Office of Communications  3  With these trusted leaders aiding our efforts, we were able to get hundreds of thousands in Kansas City and St"
33, Louis vaccinated
34," Additionally, seated in the upper chamber is Colonel Russell Kohl with the Missouri National Guard, who helped lead our state vaccine operations"
35, Colonel Kohl and our Missouri National Guard members worked around the clock to get vaccines to Missourians as quickly as possible
36,  Our Missouri National Guard members answered the call… and completed the mission
37," Would Michael, James, Pastor Miles, Janet, and Colonel Kohl please stand to be recognized?  Missouri is a diverse state and a one-size fits all approach will never work here"
38,"   In this state, we used common sense and took a balanced approach to the pandemic…  AND while that may not seem like a novel idea…When you look to some of the policies and mandates in other states and places… you find that common sense may not be so common"
39,"   That’s why we never had state mandates or forced businesses, schools, or churches to close"
40,   We protected lives and livelihoods
41,"  AND when it comes to COVID-19 mandates, I firmly believe that the people should have say through their local elected representatives and not be dictated by needless executive action or any one person"
42,   That’s why I don’t support and have never supported mandates and Missourians can rest assured that my position WILL NOT CHANGE
43,"  Today, our economy has nearly fully recovered, and we have the opportunity to make fundamental improvements to our state that will serve Missourians now and into the future"
44,    Missouri is STRONG today and will be EVEN STRONGER tomorrow
45,"  Missouri has a solid foundation and that is something we should all be proud of… Republicans, Democrats, and Independents … rural, suburban, and urban…  4 Missouri Governor — Michael L"
46, Parson Office of Communications   It is a foundation that has helped propel our state to new heights in just a few short years and has set us on a course to achieve even greater accomplishments
47,"  Unfortunately, it seems success can get purposely overshadowed because positive news doesn’t sell headlines"
48," But rest assured, we refuse to discount the good things happening in Missouri"
49," Whether you live in the bootheel, the Ozarks, St"
50," Louis, Kansas City, or anywhere across the state, our relentless focus on workforce development and infrastructure is paying dividends for ALL Missourians"
51,    Our unemployment rate sits at 3
52,"5 percent, that’s below where we were BEFORE the pandemic and below the national average"
53,"   And when we had an all time high of 385,000 individuals on unemployment, we knew we had to take action and solve this problem"
54,"   Missouri was one of the first in the nation to cutoff federal unemployment benefits…and today, only 21,000 are drawing benefits"
55,   This was the right call and the right thing to do
56,"  We are finding economic success, but with 116,000 job openings across the state, now more than ever, it is important to double down on workforce development and skill up our workers to fill these open jobs"
57,   We can’t be satisfied with the same as before
58, We must focus on making our state even stronger
59,"  Even during the pandemic, we created more than 21,000 NEW jobs and saw nearly $5"
60,2 BILLION dollars in private investment
61,"  In 2021, we saw new businesses and existing businesses expanding their footprint in Missouri, including:  Deli Star with nearly $100 million dollars invested and 475 new jobs in St"
62," Louis, Gateway Studios with $111 million dollars invested and more than 100 new jobs created in Chesterfield, M-E-M-C, a semiconductor manufacturing company, invested $210 million dollars and 75 new jobs created in O’Fallon, and John Deere Reman with $11 million dollars and 130 new jobs created in Springfield… Missouri Governor — Michael L"
63, Parson Office of Communications  5  BUT business investment didn’t just occur near Missouri’s urban centers
64," We saw… Carlisle Construction Materials invest $62 million dollars and create 100 new jobs in Sikeston, Swift Prepared Foods invested $250 million dollars and created nearly 400 new jobs in Moberly and Columbia,  American Foods Group plans to invest $450 million dollars and create 1,300 new jobs in Warren County Amazon created 400 new jobs in Republic,  Frozen Food Express invested $6 million dollars and created 60 new jobs in Butler, CoffeeTree Group created 50 new jobs in Marceline, a town of just 2,000 people, AND we could go on and on"
65," But the point is, whether in our small towns, big cities, or anywhere in between, Missouri is open for business…and business is GOOD"
66,  The rest of the nation is taking notice and companies are looking to our state for their future business expansions
67,"  AND while we’re at it, I want all of you to hear some of the amazing recognitions and rankings our state has earned because we ALL work together:   We are 1st in the United States for On-The-Job Training  We are 3rd in the United States for apprenticeships We are 3rd in the United States for our business tax index – far outranking all of our neighboring states"
68,   We are 4th in the United States for new manufacturing facilities  We are 4th in the United States for the best place to retire  We are 5th in the United States for our low cost of doing business Missouri Governor — Michael L
69," Parson Office of Communications  6  We are 7th in the United States for people relocating to our state We are 7th in the United States for Tech Manufacturing Growth Believe it or not…I’m only half way through… We are 8th in the United States for economic recovery, We are 8th in the United States for best place to work for nurses, We are 9th in the United States for military retirees, We are 9th in the United States for housing affordability, We are 10th in the United States for our Automobile and Aerospace industries,  We are 10th in the United States for new business expansion, We are 10th in the United States for site selection, And now Ladies, listen to this one…We are 10th in the United States for Women in Technology"
70," Later this evening when we share these rankings with each of you, I hope you promote these wins for every district…every county…every Missourian"
71,   The bottom line is Missouri’s economy is STRONG
72,"  With a historic budget surplus and federal dollars coming to our state, we want to build on our past momentum to capture even greater opportunities for the future of Missourians"
73,   But I want to remind you that our economy is strong despite federal funding
74," When other states will be using federal dollars to fill spending gaps and budget shortfalls…  We will be making investments in the future, because in Missouri, we took a common sense approach to the pandemic, never shutdown businesses, and have always had a conservative and balanced budget"
75,  You will be happy to hear that thanks to record economic performance…  Missourians will receive an additional tax cut this year
76,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
77, Parson Office of Communications  7  The tax rate will be reduced to a new low of 5
78,"3 percent, easing Missourians’ tax burden yet again"
79,"  Thanks to common sense, responsible spending, and working with the General Assembly, this will be the second (2nd) time our administration has cut taxes for Missourians"
80,"   However, we must work to maintain this strong economic position by establishing a Cash Operating Expense Fund"
81,   By setting aside an additional 2
82,"5 percent of general revenue, we will achieve financial stability when the rainy days come"
83,"  This is the responsible thing to do… this is the conservative thing to do… this is the right thing to do…  From the beginning, we challenged the legislature to support workforce development and infrastructure, strengthen our communities, and improve government"
84,   AND we have achieved some historic wins in each of those areas…together
85,"   Workforce and Education  This session, we must recommit ourselves to helping skill up our workforce and preparing the next generations for the demands of the future"
86," Over the last few years, it has become more important than ever to provide adults with opportunities to learn new skills and develop their career potential"
87,"  In just a short time, and despite the pandemic, our Fast Track program saw a 65 percent increase in participants in 2021"
88," To our surprise, 80 percent of the recipients are women and 50 percent are first-generation college students"
89,"  Additionally, more than 50 percent are enrolled in health care programs, which has become a blessing considering the past 22 months"
90,  We are happy to have two outstanding Fast Track participants from Bolivar Technical College with us here today
91, Shanisha Alexander and Bryan Webb are pursuing degrees in nursing
92, Missouri Governor — Michael L
93, Parson Office of Communications  8  And we are proud of these students for their commitment and working toward a better future for themselves and their families
94,  Would Miss Alexander and Mr
95," Webb please stand to be recognized?  As you can see, this program is making a real difference for many Missourians and that is why we must permanently establish this program"
96," In 2019, we also revamped Missouri One Start through the Talent for Tomorrow initiative and today that program is ranked NINTH in the United States"
97,"  In just three years, Missouri One Start has assisted companies locating or expanding in Missouri with more than 700 programs aimed at recruiting and training new employees"
98," More than 76,000 workers have received training through this successful program"
99,"  To continue on this path, we must have a talented and dedicated team across state government"
100,"  I know that many of you would agree, that Missouri has some of the best of the best in our ranks"
101," The success of our state relies heavily on these public servants, and we must ensure we are able to recruit and retain quality team members to serve Missouri"
102, AND that is why we are proposing an immediate 5
103,5 percent cost of living adjustment for all state employees
104,  This is long overdue
105, Another group of dedicated state team members is my Cabinet
106, Our administration wouldn’t have success without these individuals leading our state workforce
107,"  Leading 16 departments and 42,000 individuals is no small task, but we couldn’t be more proud of the work they do every day"
108,  Would members of my Cabinet please stand to be recognized for the incredible things you have done for the citizens of the great State of Missouri
109,    Missouri Governor — Michael L
110," Parson Office of Communications  9  The future of Missouri – and Missouri families – relies upon children being healthy, safe, and ready to learn"
111, We must continue to invest in our children and their education
112,"   My own daughter is a public school teacher, and I know the tough jobs our educators take on"
113, But they answer the call and work hard every day to prepare the next generation of Missourians
114,  Our students deserve a quality education and their parents demand it
115,  And that is why we are again fully funding the Foundation Formula
116,"   Our teachers, administrators, and staff work tirelessly to support Missouri’s students…  Last year, 95 percent of Missouri schools saw the value of in-person learning and did the right thing by keeping their doors open and our kids in schools where they belong"
117,"  AND thanks to their efforts, Missouri ranked 5th in the United States for highest proportion of in-person learning during the 20-21 school year"
118,"   Nothing can replace the classroom, and we are proud of those who recognize this and thank them for their dedication to Missouri children"
119,"   Unfortunately, Missouri is currently ranked 50th in United States for starting teacher pay and half of our new teachers leave the profession by their fifth year"
120,"   This is unacceptable, and we must do better"
121,"    That is why we are proposing to raise teacher pay in every corner of this state…  By partnering with local school districts, we can increase the baseline salary for new teachers to $38,000 dollars…and take the first step in addressing this issue"
122,  I want to take a moment to highlight one of our exceptional educators here in Missouri
123,  Ms
124, Beth Houf is the principal of Fulton Middle School and was recently named the National Principal of the year by the National Association of Secondary School Principals
125,   This marks the first time in our state history that a Missouri principal has earned this top recognition
126,   10  Missouri Governor — Michael L
127," Parson Office of Communications  We know the vast majority of Missouri educators get it right day-in and day-out, and Ms"
128, Houf is a shining example of someone who gets it right
129,  Ms
130," Houf, would you please stand to be recognized?   No one in this chamber would be where they are today without quality educators in their lives"
131,
132,
133,myself included
134,"   In the current labor shortage, we must make lasting investments in our state’s continuing education programs to prepare the next generations for the jobs of the future"
135,   That is why we are requesting $31 million dollars for our colleges and universities through MO Excels projects
136, This will help expand enrollment in high-demand jobs
137,"   Additionally, we are investing $20 million dollars in grant funding for our 57 area career centers to expand career and technical education programs"
138,"   With us here today, are students in career and technical education programs that represent schools and communities across the state that will benefit from these investments…  •  From Northland Career Center’s law enforcement training academy, we have… o  Major Audrey Strope and Sergeant Nate Wassam"
139,"  •  From Cape Girardeu Career and Technology Center, we have… o  Nicholas Hodges, Computer Networking and Security o  Lydia Strickland, Graphic Design o  Anwyn Suhr, Digital Media  •  From Carthage Technical Center Health Sciences, we have… o  Olivia Bourgaulet o  Danny Darland o  Carly Simpson   •  From Jefferson City Nichols Career Center, we have Cody Elliot, a 2nd year welding student"

141," Parson Office of Communications  11  o  Haley Dowell, Auto Collision, o  Joel Mound, Diesel Technology"
142,"   It’s programs like these that offer a path for students to pursue high-demand, good-paying jobs, and we must continue to support them in this state"
143,  Please join me in recognizing these hard-working students
144,"     After working closely with Missouri’s higher education institutions, we are very proud to be able to increase our investment in higher education"
145,  We will recommend funding for the top capital improvement at state community colleges and 4-year institutions
146,"   Combined with the MoExcels projects and scholarship opportunities, this investment will total nearly $600 million dollars…   AND generate over $1"
147,1 billion dollars in economic impact for our state
148,"  Infrastructure As I’ve often said, workforce development and infrastructure go hand in hand"
149," For our state to be successful, we must invest in both"
150,  Communities across the state are faced with costly public water and wastewater system repair and replacement
151," In order for individuals to live, work, and raise a family, the maintenance and improvement of these public systems must be a priority"
152,  The state and local governments must work together to make meaningful and lasting investments that will strengthen every town and county in the state
153," Under our proposal, we will make $250 million dollars available to communities across the state to enhance access to safe drinking water and responsible wastewater… AND $150 million dollars to enhance storm water systems"
154,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
155," Parson Office of Communications  12  While I do not agree with the massive expansion of federal debt, the responsibility falls to us to invest wisely and make smart decisions…we must do what the federal government cannot"
156,"  Speaking of strengthening our communities, we are incredibly proud of the progress that has been made thanks to Focus on Bridges"
157, This program set out to repair or replace 250 bridges across the state
158,"  We are now nearing completion of 75 percent of those bridges, and this program’s success has allowed us to leverage hundreds of millions of dollars in additional infrastructure investments in every region of the state"
159, It is critical that we continue making these important investments
160,  That is why we are proposing $75 million dollars to continue our Transportation Cost-Share program for road and bridge projects that bring economic impact to our state…  And $100 million dollars to improve low-volume roads and minor routes across the state of Missouri
161,"  These are the hardest routes to fund and are important to local communities, especially in rural Missouri"
162,  This investment will help us free up additional funding for much needed projects in suburban and urban areas…leaving no region behind
163,"  This year, we are also proposing $400 million dollars to further increase broadband, the largest single investment in state history"
164," This investment will increase access across Missouri for rural areas, but also urban areas that are under-served"
165,"  With this plan, we will connect 75,000 households with high-speed broadband"
166, AND invest $30 million dollars toward constructing and upgrading cell towers to expand wireless networks across the state
167,  This is another core investment we are making for the next generation and the future of our state…   Agriculture Missouri Governor — Michael L
168, Parson Office of Communications  13  Road and bridge repair and broadband expansion are not only important for every Missourian but are critical for our state’s number one industry…Agriculture
169,"  For Missouri agriculture to remain strong, we must prioritize the extension of critical agricultural tax credits that support Missouri farmers and ranchers, ag-businesses, and value-added products"
170,  Because we must always stand with Missouri’s diverse group of agricultural producers
171," These men and women wake up every day to feed and fuel the world, AND this has been especially true over the past 22 months"
172," When we were facing tough food-supply chain issues…they adjusted, they adapted, and they put food on the table, allowing us to avoid the hardships experienced in other states"
173, That is why we are calling for $10 million dollars to expand agriculture innovation and workforce programs
174, Investments like this help ensure the agriculture way of life in the state of Missouri can be passed down to the next generations
175,"  Speaking of the next generations, seated in the upper gallery, we have members of the Paris, Missouri FFA Chapter, which was recently recognized as the 2021 National FFA Chapter of the year"
176,
177,
178, the highest award a chapter can earn in the nation
179,"  Out of nearly 9,000 chapters nationwide, we are proud to be home to the National FFA Chapter of the year and even prouder of the Paris students"
180,"  Would members of the Paris FFA, please stand to be recognized?  With nearly $94 billion dollars in economic impact and nearly 460,000 jobs, Missouri is an agriculture state, and we must never forget it"
181,"  AND as a third-generation farmer, you can rest assured that agriculture will always remain a top priority for this administration"
182,  Community Investments Another area of focus this year is on creating more opportunities for our communities
183,   Missouri Governor — Michael L
184," Parson Office of Communications  14  To further our goal to use public resources to make meaningful, long-term investments across the state, we will set aside $250 million dollars for a statewide revitalization grant program to spur local economic development"
185,"  This program will help bring economic opportunity to communities across the state, train more workers, define competitive advantages, and bring more jobs to Missouri"
186,"    Another asset for communities all across the state, is our state park and conservation network that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year"
187,"  More and more people are getting out and experiencing Missouri’s great outdoors…  AND this year, we have an opportunity to solidify this state asset and economic driver and expand tourism"
188,"  By investing $69 million dollars to start construction on the Rock Island trail… We can help establish the largest circular rail-to-trail network in the United States and a world-class, one-of-a-kind destination for travelers coming to Missouri…while also supporting businesses and creating jobs"
189,  Health Care One of the lessons we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must also support our communities by strengthening our health care networks across the state
190, That is why we are asking for a $34 million dollar investment in rural communities to increase access to telehealth and telemedicine services
191,  Another historic investment we are recommending is a new multi-agency state health laboratory
192,"  This lab will accommodate the needs of the Department of Health and Senior Services, Department of Agriculture, Department of Conservation, and Department of Natural Resources and join them together on one campus"
193," This will lead to safer, healthier Missourians and a more efficient use of public resources"
194,"  This year, we are also proposing to double the capacity of our Missouri Autism centers"
195,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
196, Parson Office of Communications  15  This will help more families navigate the challenges of treating autism…  And reduce the backlog for Missouri families desperately needing services
197,  I want to thank State Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick and the First Lady for helping bring this to our attention and working to get this done
198,"   Public Safety This year, we must take a renewed look at public safety and how best to fight violent crime"
199,   We must continue to support our law enforcement professionals who put their lives on the line to protect our families
200,"  We can do this by ensuring consistent requirements and appropriate penalties to hold violent criminals accountable…  While also protecting Missourian’s second amendment rights, just as our administration has always done"
201,"  That said, it’s not just how we deal with violent criminals, we must make sure those with behavioral health and substance use disorders receive the treatment and support they need"
202,"  Last year, with the support of the General Assembly, we made great progress in providing proper treatment options to Missourians by increasing community support through crisis stabilization centers and community behavioral health liaisons"
203,"  This year, we are asking to provide an additional $140 million dollars to support and increase services at health centers across the state"
204,"    Last year, we also highlighted the first law enforcement training academy in the country at a historically Black college at Lincoln University"
205,"   AND this year, we are building on that investment with over $11 million dollars for upgrades and to provide more scholarships for law enforcement officers to receive POST certification and put more officers on the streets"
206,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
207," Parson Office of Communications  16  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Williams, Senator Leutkemeyer, and Representative Roberts we can ensure our law enforcement professionals are using policing strategies and techniques that make us all proud"
208,  With us here today is a very special guest…Missouri State Highway Patrol Trooper Colton J
209, Beck
210,"  In December, Trooper Beck was attempting to conduct a routine traffic stop when the suspect fled and a pursuit ensued"
211," The suspect then opened fire on Trooper Beck, striking him in the face, neck, and upper torso"
212,"  Despite being seriously injured, Trooper Beck remained calm and assisted his fellow officers despite the threat posed to his life"
213,  He is a proud example of all law enforcement officers who serve this state honorably
214," Would you please join me in giving Trooper Beck a well-deserved round of applause?  Missourians respect law and order, but as a former Sheriff it alarms me to see some of the attitudes toward those who have taken an oath to defend our communities and keep us safe"
215,   We must work to strengthen our communities by supporting our men and women in law enforcement
216,  AND learn from the failed policies in other cities and states to never allow anti-law enforcement measures to take hold in this state
217,"  In Missouri, we DEFEND law enforcement, not defund them"
218,"  During my very first state of the state, I laid out our strategy to focus on workforce development and infrastructure…  Now, we have real opportunity to make lasting investments in these areas and the future of our state…  But with these opportunities comes a responsibility to be mindful about the role of government and where and how it should be involved"
219,  Government should invest…not waste;   Missouri Governor — Michael L
220, Parson Office of Communications  17  Government should lead…not dictate;   Government should support…not mandate;   AND we must all remember that
221,"   In this state…  We have created tens of thousands of new jobs, but we can do more"
222,"  We have built hundreds of new bridges and repaired thousands of miles of road, but we can do more"
223,"  We have expanded broadband to thousands of homes and businesses, but we can do more"
224,"  We have strengthened communities in urban areas, in suburban areas, in rural areas, but we can do more"
225,  AND we are ready to stand with each and every one of you to do more for the people of Missouri
226,   It is our time…and the time is now
227,"  CONCLUSION In closing, there’s a story from this past year that I want to share with all of you…  In September, I stood on the tarmac at Lambert Airport when a young man made his return home and when a family found the courage to welcome him…one last time"
228,  Corporal Jared Schmitz made the ultimate sacrifice for his bravery in defending his nation during the withdrawal from Afghanistan
229,"   He did his duty with honor and without question to protect freedom for his family, his community, his state, and his nation"
230,"   AND in such a difficult moment, one wonders how we can ever make it through…but by taking a look around, you can always find the answer… our people"
231,  When our nation couldn’t be more divided…I saw a community that couldn’t be closer
232,  Missouri Governor — Michael L
233," Parson Office of Communications  18  When a family felt pain and loss…I saw them embraced by friends, neighbors, and total strangers"
234,  In THIS challenging moment…I saw the best of who Missourians are
235,  And that’s why I’m proud to be the Governor of this great state
236,   AND as we close out these past 22 months and look to our next chapter…remember…our strength is our people
237,"  When times are hard, Missourians move forward"
238,"   When someone is down, Missourians lift them up"
239,"  These past years have been tough and dividing for a lot of people, but Missourians stay true…they give their best…and they always put others first"
240,  AND we are a better state…a better people… because of it
241,"   When we look to the future and not dwell in the past, when we find solutions instead of problems…when we stand together instead of apart…we can accomplish anything"
242,"    We must always Keep Pushing Forward in this state, because no one is coming to do it for us"
243,   Missouri is STRONG today and will be EVEN STRONGER tomorrow
244,   It is an honor and privilege to serve as the 57th Governor of the state of Missouri
245,"   God bless you, God bless the great state of Missouri, and God bless the United States of America"

5,   To the members of the legislature and other elected ofﬁcials – thank you
6, Thank you for yourcommitment to bettering our state
7, Thank you for your dedication to our people
8,"   Together, we can do great things"
9," I look forward to partnering with you this session to continuemaking Mississippi the best state in the nation to live, to work, and to raise a family"
10,   I would also be remiss if I did not thank the person who enables me to stand here in the ﬁrstplace
11, Someone who always puts others before herself
12, Someone who is an amazingambassador for our state – our great First Lady
13," Elee, thank you for everything you do for meand for Mississippi"

18, We have bent but we did notbreak
19, We dug deep and we stood tall
20, We got through it all because we decided to getthrough it all together
21,"   That is why, after recession and pandemic and hurricanes and tornadoes, I can still standbefore you tonight and declare, without reservation, and without qualiﬁcation, that the state ofour state is not only strong, but stronger than it has ever been"
22,   I would like to start with what I consider to be the crowning achievement of Mississippi’s ridethrough the pandemic and recession – our educators
23,   It is the most basic promise a state government makes to its people
24, We tell every youngparent: we will be your partner in educating your child
25," Together, we will make sure that if theywork hard, they will learn what they need to know"
26,   It is a solemn promise and one that our state must fulﬁll – and it is a promise that I amdetermined to fulﬁll
27,   We all know that there are many who enjoy criticizing Mississippi
28," They trash our way of life,they trash our institutions, and they frequently deride our education"
29,"   And at times in our past, they might have been at least a little bit right about our educationalsystem"
30," But Mississippi’s schools have made a major turnaround – in fact, a turnaround ofhistoric proportions"
31,"   When you look at the data, it looks like a miracle"
32, But it is not a miracle
33," It is the product ofdedication of our teachers, a result of the intelligence of our people, and conservative,common-sense reforms enacted by many of us here today"
34," And most importantly, it isachievement that was earned by Mississippi students"
35,   Mississippi’s students with disabilities have seen a graduation rate that has doubled over thelast eight years
36," Overall, our graduation rate is now at an all-time high at 87"
37,7 percent
38," That’s,by the way, better than the national average"
39," And while the graduation rate is at an all-timehigh, the dropout rate is at an all-time low of just 8"
40,8 percent
41,   Our passing rate on Advanced Placement exams is also at an all-time high
42,   The number of students who completed career and technical courses has shot up by 36percent since 2015

46,   You all know how fond I am of data
47, I love it
48, I swim in it
49," It’s what I do for fun – and yes, Irealize how uncool that makes me"
50," In fact, just ask my teenage daughters if you have anydoubt about how uncool I am"
51,   But this is not merely data on a page
52, These numbers are real people
53, These are real lives thathave been transformed – and family trajectories that have been forever altered
54,   The Mississippi kids who have out-performed previous generations in the classroom are goingto make our state better as adults
55, We are talking about generational change in careers andhorizons – and it is happening in every corner of Mississippi
56,   I attribute these educational gains to three important factors
57," First, the parents and guardiansof our students"
58," Without you investing in your children’s educations, without you pushing themto be their very best, none of these gains would be possible"
59,   It all starts and ends with parents
60, Mississippi schools and teachers answer to parents
61, Theyare paid for by you
62, They work for you
63,"   It is shocking to me, that in some corners of this country, the basic right of parents to determinetheir child’s education is ignored"
64, We must strive to be better than that
65, We recognize that noclassroom can replace a parent’s care
66," Your voice should not just be heard, it should besought"
67, It should reign
68, All public servants answer to the people
69," In education, we answer tothe parents and as long as I’m governor, we always will"
70,   We’ve also seen these historic gains because of the conservative and effective educationreforms we’ve implemented over the last decade
71,   Expect more and you will get more
72, That is a lesson Mississippi has had to learn
73,   The rigorous reading standards that we put in place have transformed lives and the data proveit
74,"   Since those standards were created, we’ve experienced incredible gains in fourth gradereading"
75," Just a few months ago The Economist noted, Mississippi’s fourth graders rose 20places – from 49th to 29th – on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), andin 2019 we were the “only state in the nation to improve its scores"

79," In 2019, Mississippi was the only state in the nation to improve ourTranslatescores"
80, The only state
81," Out of 50, we were the very best at improving reading scores"
82,   Students of all backgrounds are having academic success in Mississippi
83," According to 2019NAEP results, our students living in poverty are outperforming their peers nationally"
84," Black,white, and Hispanic students from low-income households achieved higher scores than thenational average in all four NAEP subjects"
85,"   For decades we were at the bottom, but now we are not"
86, It takes time to go from last to ﬁrst
87,"But Mississippi kids are on the move, and it is revitalizing our state’s future"
88,"   Now, they say imitation is the sincerest form of ﬂattery"
89," Well, all of you should be ﬂattered"
90,"Again, according to The Economist – and this is a direct quote – “Many states have noticedMississippi’s success and have passed similar legislation"
91,"”   When is the last time you heard that? From Pascagoula to Iuka and from Natchez to Tunica,every single person in Mississippi should be proud"
92,"   These education reforms and the gains they have wrought, is what happens whenRepublicans and Democrats come together"
93," When we set aside our differences, and focus onwhat matters most, there is no limit to what Mississippians can achieve"
94,"   That is why I am asking the legislature to keep it up, and to invest in math coaches, just as wedid for reading, to ensure that we continue to see improved results"
95,   The ﬁnal vital factor in our education gains is our teachers
96," Unlike other states throughout thepandemic, most of Mississippi’s teachers stepped up"
97, They did not cower in fear and refuse tocome into the classroom
98," In fact, it was just the opposite"
99," While other states resorted to Zoomfor years on end, Mississippi’s teachers took to the chalkboard"
100," When teachers in other statessaid, “no we won’t,” Mississippi’s teachers said, “yes we will"

112,   But we chose to not let that happen
113," Teachers in Mississippi did not, and will not, back downamid this unprecedented educational battle between a virus and a child’s right to learn"
114,   That is why we must give our teachers the pay raise they deserve
115,   Y’all know that I am a conservative
116, Many of you are too

118, There is no doubt that Mississippi teachers ﬁt that mold

120, It is my number one priority
121," Credit goes to where credit is due and in COVID-19,Mississippi teachers deserve the credit"
122,   There is one cloud on the horizon for our schools and it’s one that we need to address
123,"   Across the country, there is a looming threat in too many schools"
124, It is propaganda that seeksto divide us

128, I’m interested in the integrity of our civic education
129," In toomany schools in other states, they teach the lie that America is inherently racist"
130, They teachstudents that by virtue of the color of your skin you are inherently a victim or oppressor
131, Theyteach this for a purpose
132,   It is designed to allow a small group of idealogues to pose as saviors—false heroes
133," It isarrogance and ambition, masquerading as education"
134," When you are a victim by birth, only theirgenerosity can save you"
135," When you are an oppressor by birth, only your silent cooperationwith their radical worldview can sanctify you"
136,   There is no country on this earth without sin in its past
137, That is because there is no person onthis earth without sin
138, Sin is inherent in the human condition
139, Injustice is still too present today
140,We must teach that truth
141, We must learn from our history
142,   But we can also proudly teach that America is the ﬁrst nation in history to be born of ideals—not just blood and soil
143," We are not a nation created by a tribe, but a melting pot of peoplecommitted to common purpose"
144,   We work to live up to those ideals every single day

151, Racism is not unique to America
152, Injustice is not unique to America
153, It is endemicin humanity because humanity is sinful
154, But the American notion that God grants rights that noone can take away – that notion is still transforming the entire planet
155,"   When we teach American children to fear one another because of their skin, we reverse thegreat trend towards achieving our American dream"
156, The promise of America is replaced with avicious lie: that you are doomed to failure or evil based on your race
157," We must stop this trendin its tracks, and we can do our part in Mississippi"
158,"   Today, I am calling on the State Board of Education to adopt the values that combat criticalrace theory in their educational efforts"
159," To afﬁrm that Mississippi’s public educators will notindoctrinate students in ideology that insists this country, or this state, are inherently racist"
160, Wewill not teach that your race determines your status as a victim or oppressor
161, No school districtshall teach that one race is inherently superior or that an individual is unconsciously orinherently racist because of how they are born
162, No child will be divided or humiliated becauseof their race

164,   This is an important common step we can take to ensure that Mississippi is committed toequality
165," Honesty about our past, and bold and optimistic determination about our future"
166,   The legislature can bolster that effort by passing legislation to this effect

314," That can not only ﬁll the days, it canset an offender up for a peaceful life on the outside"
315,"   Just last month, Commissioner Cain unveiled a mobile welding training center that will helptrain inmates for a career in welding, post-release"
316, The mobile welding training center – whichby the way was not paid for with taxpayer funds – can train 32 inmates at a time and will rotatebetween prisons every 90 days
317," At the end of the program, trainees who complete it willreceive a certiﬁcation that they can use to ﬁnd a job"

Why should we allocate fundstowards educational opportunities for those who are incarcerated? The answer is actuallypretty straightforward – because it’s a wise investment"
323,   The proof is in the numbers
324, The average cost to house an inmate in 2020 was over $50 a day

5, Chief Justice Kempand Justices of the Supreme Court; and Members of the General Assembly
6,It is an honor to stand before the joint chambers today for my 8th and final State of the Statespeech
7,For that reason please allow me a moment of personal reflection
8,The opportunity to serve and lead the state I love has been the highest privilege of my publiccareer
9,"As you know, I was raised on a farm on the Spavinaw Creek near Gravette"
10, I was the youngest ofsix children born to John Malcolm and Coral Hutchinson
11," They were married in the GreatDepression and understood tough times; they did not have college degrees but they valuedlearning and encouraged me to pursue my dreams and, most importantly, to have faith and trustin our Creator who reigns sovereign in the affairs of man"
12,But the most important person in my life is the girl I was so crazy about that I hitchhiked fromFayetteville to Memphis on the weekends to see her
13, Susan has celebrated every victory with meand walked with me through every trial
14," Let me introduce my sweetheart of 48 years and theFirst Lady, Susan Hutchinson"
15,"Susan has devoted time, energy, and her voice to helping the abused and neglected children inour state"
16,"My family is important to me, and I am grateful, my son and namesake is here, Asa HutchinsonIII"
17,"1Today, I am also grateful for the partnership of the General Assembly"
18," Every once in a while wedisagree, but all in all, we have worked together and accomplished a great deal for the people ofour state"
19, Our work together has not been for the weak of heart but it has been transformative andwill impact generations to come
20,"Seven years ago, I took office with the desire to improve the quality of life in Arkansas byimproving education, increasing our manufacturing, preserving our outdoor heritage, andsupporting our farmers"
21,"I wanted to be the jobs governor, and through the work of Mike Preston and the ArkansasEconomic Development Commission and our many partners, we’ve had historic success"
22,We now have the lowest unemployment ever at 3
23,1% and a record number of Arkansansworking
24,"We have signed 556 incentive agreements that created 25,000 jobs"
25,"81,000 more people are employed now than when I took office in 2015"
26,"On my first day in office, I called the CEOs of six companies"
27, One of those companies was SigSauer
28,"A year later, they opened a facility in Jacksonville employing Arkansans and continue to grow"
29,The long list of companies that have expanded or moved to Arkansas represents billions ofdollars of investment
30,This is a sampling of the companies that have moved here or expanded- Cynergy Cargo in Crossett
31,- Nestle in Jonesboro
32,- Aerojet Rocketdyne in Camden- Trex in Little Rock
33,- EnviroTech in Helena-West Helena
34,- Vexus Boats in Flippin

42,S
43, Steel announcement on the construction of a new steel mill in Osceola
44, This is anothercalling card for our state
45,It means:- A $3 billion investment with more than 900 new high-paying jobs;- Mississippi County will be the Number 1 steel-producing county in the nation
46,- And this would not have been possible without the support of the General Assembly in passinglegislation necessary to win the project
47,  Thank you
48,But there is more
49," In Arkansas, we support our military bases and their missions"
50, That is why weworked so hard to bring in the F-35 pilot training mission to Ebbing Air National Guard Base inFort Smith
51, This will be an economic boon for Western Arkansas for decades to come
52,But another reason that we have been successful in job creation is that we made it a priority tocut taxes
53,When I came into office I promised to cut middle-income taxes by $100 million
54, People said itcouldn’t be done
55," Well, we did it in the first year"
56, Then we went on to provide tax relief to everyArkansan
57, We have lowered the individual income tax rate from 7
58,0% when I was elected to5
59,5% this year
60, And there is more to come
61,3These reductions return money from the government coffers to the hard-working Arkansans whoneed this money to pay for the increasing costs of providing for their family
62, They need fuel toget to work each day and tax cuts allow them to have more money in their pocket to invest orspend on the necessities of life
63,The cumulative total of these annual income tax reductions over the past seven years exceeds $1billion
64,"We did this while also giving teachers raises, increasing funding for education, and creating arecord $1"
65,2 billion reserve fund
66,"In addition, we saw the need for improved roads and highways in Arkansas, so we met thechallenge by doing the heavy lifting of passing the largest highway funding plan in history"
67,We saw the need of our foster children and we gave them HOPE
68,"We wanted a more efficient and responsive state government, so we transformed it from 42departments down to 15"
69," We have reduced the number of state employees by over 2,000 since2015"
70,We navigated our way through a pandemic and we kept our schools open because we knew ourchildren needed to be in the classroom
71," I knew in Arkansas every business was essential, so wenever sheltered in place or stopped producing"
72,These businesses are not only essential for our families but also for the world
73, We produce andthe world depends upon us
74,"In the spirit of comity and friendship, the General Assembly and the Executive Branch came toan agreement on most issues during the last two years; and when we disagreed, well we justdisagreed"
75, But that did not stop the goodwill or our ability to work together
76,"Now, let me pause and recognize 3 representatives of public servants who have sacrificed andendured extraordinary hardship to get us through this pandemic"
77,Let me introduce Juanita Ellison
78, Juanita was a senior in high school in Camden when shedecided she wanted to teach school
79, She earned a degree at Southern Arkansas University
80, She4taught at Camden Public Schools and then moved to Jacksonville where she teaches K-5 specialeducation
81,Juanita Ellison is a dedicated teacher and she represents all of our teachers who have gone theextra mile to help our students
82,Please join me in recognizing Juanita Ellison and saying thanks to our teachers across Arkansas
83,"Next, I want to introduce Emily McGee who is a critical care nurse in the ICU unit of St"
84,Bernard Regional Medical Center in Jonesboro
85, Emily was the director of critical care andoversaw the expansion of critical care at the hospital during the pandemic
86,Emily represents our health care professionals who we all celebrate as heroes during the last twoyears
87, They serve us every day
88, Let’s express our thanks and God bless you
89,Our third and last special guest is Trooper Zenda Staab of the Arkansas State Police
90, Zenda wasan Assistant Basketball Coach before she joined the State Police
91, She is also an MP in theArkansas National Guard
92,Without going into all the details Zenda took heroic actions in 3 separate incidences in order tosave lives
93," In one instance, Zenda initiated the pursuit of a stolen car"
94," When the suspect crossedover to drive against traffic on a four-lane highway, she executed a U-turn and stopped himhead-on with her cruiser"
95, The suspect was traveling 70 mph
96," Before the stolen car stoppedspinning, she was out of her seatbelt, out of the car, and drawing her weapon"
97," The actions ofTrooper Staab, at great risk to her own safety, kept the public safe and saved lives"
98,Please recognize Trooper Staab
99, She represents all those in law enforcement that risk their livesevery day for our safety and to enforce the rule of law
100,"Thank you to Juanita, Emily and Zenda for your service"
101,"Before we move into the future, let’s spend a moment reflecting on history"
102," In 1956, theEisenhower administration laid out a bold plan to change the way Americans moved"
103," TheInterstate Highway System connected all parts of America, even previously remote states likeArkansas"
104, This concept was bold at a time when many Americans traveled interstate by train
105,"Investment in the interstate system helped create unprecedented growth in travel, business, andtourism"
106," Without our interstates, companies like Walmart, J"
107,B
108," Hunt, and FedEx may never have5grown into the business titans they are today"
109," President Eisenhower wisely saw where the futureof mobility was heading, and his vision made America a leader in that future"
110,"Now, let’s talk about our own future"
111, You have supported our students by giving themopportunities in computer science education that make Arkansas a national leader
112, Tens ofthousands of more students have an opportunity to choose a path that will make a difference inshaping the world and will provide them with a high-paying job
113,"But now, Arkansas is in a unique position to lead in future technologies that will change ourworld"
114,"Today, I am challenging Arkansas to lead in this world of innovation by focusing on the future ofadvanced mobility"
115," This focus includes autonomous vehicles, upward mobility platforms, electricvehicles, and modes of transportation that do not exist today but could be the dream of anArkansas student right now"
116,Why Arkansas?We have always led in transportation from entrepreneurs like J
117,B
118, Hunt who started hauling ricehulls from Stuttgart to NWA; and Sheridan Garrison who started Arkansas Freightways that isnow FedEx Freight; and also Steve Williams of Maverick Transportation
119,We all know that the success of our transportation industry is critical to the economic future ofArkansas
120,  And to position our state for the future we must act today because the future of supplychain deliveries will be different tomorrow from the trucks on our road today
121," So, let’s keepleading"
122,"This past year between the Delta variant surge and Omicron, I was able to make an economicdevelopment trip to Israel"
123,  I spoke at the Prime Minister’s Mobility Summit
124, I was preceded onthe stage by the Israeli Transportation Minister who announced that they hope to get a billthrough the Knesset to allow the piloting of autonomous vehicles
125,"Well, I was the next speaker following the Minister and I announced that Arkansas passed a lawin 2019 (2 years ago) that allowed the piloting of autonomous vehicles"
126," Further, the pilotprogram was successful, and we are now using fully automated vehicles delivering goods fromthe warehouse to the retail store"
127, It was a proud moment for Arkansas
128," But to accomplish this, it6took the work of the General Assembly, the Arkansas Department of Transportation, and theleadership of the private sector"
129,"  In this case, Walmart and Gatik"
130,"We have also recruited the headquarters of an electric vehicle manufacturing company, Canoo;and in south Arkansas, Standard Lithium is piloting the production of a critical element in thesupply chain for electric vehicles"
131," In eastern Arkansas, we produce the steel that is required forthe battery casing in electric vehicles"
132," So, we are in a good position to shape the future fromArkansas"
133,"In order for us to lead, we need to have electric charging stations across the state"
134, Arkansas isscheduled to receive $54 million over the next 5 years from the federal government for electriccharging station infrastructure
135," Quite frankly, this needs to be accelerated"
136, Oklahoma already hasit in place and we may need to devote state dollars to get it done more quickly
137,"As governor, I won’t be here for the end of the story but together we can write the first chapter"
138,"Today, I am announcing the creation of the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility"
139," The AdvisoryCouncil will be charged with identifying state laws and regulations that create a barrier to thedevelopment and enhancement of electrification, autonomous vehicles, drone delivery, andadvanced air mobility in Arkansas"
140," It will examine workforce training, accessing federal funding,and will make recommendations before the next general session of the legislature"
141,"In the future, you will have choices to make"
142, You will have the opportunity to remove regulatoryburdens and to pass legislation to advance new modes of transportation that will keep Arkansasin the lead
143, I encourage you to build on the private sector success we have in Arkansas and allowinnovation and new technologies to bolster our future
144, The businesses that drive theseinnovations in mobility will be leaders in the future economy
145, I want these companies to find ahome in Arkansas and for our state to be a leader in future mobility
146,"Of course, the reason we are here is the Fiscal Session of the General Assembly"
147," So, let mediscuss the budget that has been presented"
148,"The budget before you includes increased funding for education, health care and public safety"
149, Itincludes stable funding for the victims of crime through the Crime Victims Reparations program
150,It provides funding for child abduction response teams and for 2 new drug courts
151," And even withthose spending priorities, we will continue to have a healthy surplus"
152,"7Most importantly, this session will be remembered for our support of law enforcement"
153,"Because of your advocacy and hard work, I am able to announce support for the $5,000 one-timepayment to every county and city-certified law enforcement officer"
154, This will be one-timepayment from our surplus effective June 30 when the fiscal year ends
155, It is designed to rewardand incentivize those dedicated officers who keep our streets safe and our homes protected
156, Thetotal costs of this initiative in support of law enforcement will be approximately $45 million
157,"Next, you passed Act 786 of 2021 to create the Public Safety Equipment Grant Program"
158, Thiswas one of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Advancement of Law Enforcementthat I convened after the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide protests
159," TheTask Force wanted to increase trust between police and our communities and to improve thetraining, equipment and pay for our law enforcement officers"
160,The grant program has received applications for funding to purchase everything from bodycameras to bulletproof vests
161, We have about $5 million in equipment requests from cities andcounties but we don’t have $5 million to cover those grant requests
162, I recommend $10 million ofone-time funding from our June 30 surplus to adequately fund the $5 million in applications andanother $5m for new requests
163,"Currently, our law enforcement is underfunded, underpaid, and underappreciated"
164," The actions ofthis General Assembly to fund more, pay more, and to appreciate more will send theunmistakable message that in Arkansas…"
165,
166,we support and value our law enforcement partners
167,"As part of this effort, our budget will significantly increase the pay of our state troopers"
168, Col
169, BillBryant has been a star in leading the State Police and the troopers are deserving of a morecompetitive salary
170, The troopers not only patrol the highways but their SWAT units are regularlydeployed in crisis situations across the state
171, They back up local law enforcement in the responseand investigation of violent crime
172, I am very proud of their dedication and professionalism
173," So,while some across the country advocate for reducing police funding, we are doing the opposite"
174,We are increasing support and affirming that the first duty of government is public safety
175,I also challenge our counties and cities to step up to the plate and do more
176, Police funding mustbe a priority at every level
177,"8Currently, we have a record back up of state prisoners in our county jails"
178, This limits the countiesand cities in their capacity to enforce local laws
179,"  This backlog must be remedied and for thatreason, I recommend another one-time investment from our surplus to fund a new 498 inmateprison facility"
180,Let me emphasize that this need for a new facility is not a reflection of a change in incarcerationpolicy
181, It is simply the fact that we have a growing state
182, We are growing in projections of 1
183,4%percent
184,My finance team led by Secretary Larry Walther conservatively estimates that we will have a$500 million surplus on June 30
185, We have sufficient room to address these urgent public safetyneeds
186,"And, yes, if this surplus continues to grow then there will be an opportunity next year to returnpart of the growing surplus to the taxpayers"
187,"As to the state of our state, I am grateful to say that Arkansas is leading"
188, We are leading incomputer science education; technology innovation; agriculture; tourism; job creation; andsupport for veterans and law enforcement
189," Sure, we have more to do but our state is blessed"
190,And our nation is blessed as well
191, I think back in my lifetime and I can recall the division andprotests of the Viet Nam War; the turmoil of Watergate; the assassinations of Presidents and civilrights leaders; and the bitter political fights in Washington
192, If you simply concentrated on thosetragic moments in our history then you might be discouraged about America
193, But I alsoremember and lived through the Berlin airlift; the Cuban Missile Crisis when our leaders stoodtall against a Soviet threat; I witnessed Neil Armstrong land on the moon to win the space raceand I saw the fall of the Berlin wall
194, I observed from a very personal standpoint how we all cametogether as a nation after the 9-11 attack
195,"These moments in history remind us that leaders make a difference and that we can do more, andearn the respect of the world when we are united and when we are following the better angels ofthe American spirit"
196,Leaders can appeal to the instincts of fear or they can lead with hope
197," In today’s world and, yes,in Arkansas, let’s join together to bring out the best of our fellow citizens"
198, I have never been9more hopeful and optimistic about the future of our state
199," Let’s work with courage to unite,inspire and lead with hope"
200,Thank you
201," May God bless the state of Arkansas and give us the courage to keep Americastrong, united, and free"
