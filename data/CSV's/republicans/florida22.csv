9,"While so many around the country have consigned the people’s rights to the graveyard, Florida has stood as freedom’s vanguard"
10,"In Florida, we have protected the right of our citizens to earn a living, provided our businesses with the ability to prosper, fought back againstunconstitutional federal mandates and ensured our kids have the opportunity to thrive"
11,"Florida has become the escape hatch for those chaﬁng under authoritarian, arbitrary and seemingly never-ending mandates and restrictions"
12,"Even today, across the nation we see students denied an education due to reckless, politically-motivated school closures, workers deniedemployment due to heavy-handed mandates and Americans denied freedoms due to a coercive biomedical apparatus"
13,These unprecedented policies have been as ineffective as they have been destructive
14, They are grounded more in blind adherence to Fauciandeclarations than they are in the constitutional traditions that are the foundation of free nations
15,Florida is a free state
16," We reject the biomedical security state that curtails liberty, ruins livelihoods and divides society"
17, And we will protect therights of individuals to live their lives free from the yoke of restrictions and mandates

19, And upon this rock we must build Florida’s future
20,"We will, fortunately, be able to confront our challenges with an incredibly favorable budget outlook and strong economic performance that haswithstood unfavorable national headwinds:My recommended budget of $99"

22,Florida’s revenues have exceeded estimates by billions of dollars over the past year
23, December’s revenues came in at more than $500 million overthe latest monthly estimate
24,And this is all being done with no income tax and the lowest per capita tax burden in America
25,Job creation in Florida is far exceeding the national average
26, And our labor force has increased six times faster than the nation’s
27,"Florida also leads the nation in business formations, which have increased by 61% since I took ofﬁce in 2019"
28," In 2021, Florida saw 114,000 morenew businesses than second place California — even though California has a population that is 40% larger"
29,Freedom works
30, Our economy is the envy of the nation
31, And the state is well-prepared to withstand future economic turmoil

36, It represents a pay cut for individuals and families alike
37, And one of the ways families have felt the pinch has been insigniﬁcantly higher gas prices
38,"To help alleviate this burden for Florida families, I am proposing a $1 billion gas tax holiday to help reduce prices at the pump"
39," If Washington, D"
40,C
41,",won’t change course, then we have a responsibility to step up on behalf of Floridians"
42,Education represents a major pillar of Florida’s future
43, I’m happy to note that Florida is again ranked number three for K-12 achievement in thelatest Education Week Quality Counts rankings
44," We have worked hard to keep schools open, increase teacher compensation, promote workforceeducation and protect the rights of parents"
45,"In pockets across America, schools are closing once again"
46, These closures are enormously destructive and will not be tolerated in the state ofFlorida
47,Florida has led the way in putting our kids ﬁrst
48," In the summer of 2020, when it wasn’t fashionable, we made clear that kids needed to be in school"
49," We faced opposition — from hysterical media, from unions and the politicians they control"
50," We even faced lawsuits aiming to close the schools, butwe wouldn’t allow fear or politics to harm our kids"
51, We were right and they were wrong
52, And millions of families in Florida are better for it
53,"While it is important to embrace high academic standards and to measure student achievement, the FSA test is not the best way to do it"
54, I amproposing the elimination of the FSA and replacing it with periodic progress monitoring
55," This will lead to meaningful feedback for parents andteachers and will reduce the amount of time dedicated to testing, leaving more time for learning"
56," This reform will be better for students, teachers andparents, and it will help Florida remain a leader in education reform"
57,"Over the past two years, we have increased the average minimum salary for teachers by more than $6,000"

59,Brittany Duquaine is a teacher at Lakewood Elementary School in Pinellas County

61,"Let’s continue this progress by further increasing teacher pay and by approving $1,000 bonuses for a second year in a row"
62,Florida has enacted a Parents’ Bill of Rights and we reject the notion that parents shouldn’t have a say in what their kids learn in school

71," Over the past three years, Florida has added more than 50 new apprenticeship programs"
72," The credentials earned throughour workforce initiatives have paved the way for employment in a variety of ﬁelds like aviation, logistics and welding"

74,Florida’s dedicated focus on the skilled trades will help expand the state’s manufacturing footprint
75, We have already seen businesses move herefrom other states and we should also be actively encouraging businesses to repatriate production back to America from foreign countries
76, Do wereally want our supply chains to be captive to the whims of a country such as Communist China?Florida’s economic security is also linked to the stewardship of our natural resources
77,"We Floridians are heirs to a unique environment that makes our state the envy of the nation for ﬁshing, boating and other outdoor activities"
78," Threeyears ago, we promised bold action to safeguard Florida’s natural resources, improve water quality and restore the Everglades"
79," With the support ofthe Legislature, especially Speaker Chris Sprowls and President Wilton Simpson, we have secured historic funding to support these efforts"
80,"Since January 2019, 42 Everglades restoration projects have broken ground, hit a major milestone or ﬁnished construction, record funding has goneto conduct research and secure technologies to mitigate blue-green algae and red tide, and the state now has dedicated streams of revenue topromote coastal resiliency and water quality improvements"
81,We have even made enormous strides in removing invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades
82," In the gallery today is the reigning python king,Charlie Dachton, who caught a whopping 41 pythons in our 2021 statewide contest"

84,We also will continue to honor our commitment to safe communities

88,"com/2022/01/11/governor-ron-desantis-state-of-the-state-address-3/2/5Governor Ron DeSantis’ State of the State Address3/20/22, 9:33 PMThese soft-on-crime policies have been tried in communities throughout the country to disastrous results: crime has skyrocketed, morale for policeofﬁcers has plummeted and quality of life has been destroyed"
89,We have stood by the men and women of law enforcement
90," Not only do we reject defunding law enforcement — we enacted $1,000 bonuses for allpolice, ﬁre and EMTs in Florida"
91, I’m asking the Legislature to re-up these bonuses for another year
92, They deserve it
93,Serving in law enforcement is a noble calling and we will not allow our ofﬁcers to be smeared by reckless politicians and corporate media
94," Myproposals to increase pay for state law enforcement by up to 25% and to provide $5,000 signing bonuses to law enforcement personnel who eithertransfer to or begin their careers in Florida will spark a tidal wave of qualiﬁed professionals seeking employment at agencies throughout the state"
95,"I’m happy to be joined by Ofﬁcer Yehuda Topper from the North Miami Beach Police Department, who moved from NYC and is the state’s ﬁrstorthodox Jewish police ofﬁcer"
96,Let there be no doubt to those who wear the uniform: the state of Florida stands with you!Law and order requires strong borders
97, The crisis at the US-Mexico border over the past year has witnessed staggering illegal migration and amassive inﬂux of narcotics like fentanyl
98," Rather than defend our sovereignty and enforce the border, the federal government has released hundredsof thousands of illegal aliens to communities across the U"
99,S
100,", shipping them to Florida at alarming rates, including by sending clandestine ﬂights inthe dark of night"
101,"As a state, we cannot be a party to what is effectively a massive human smuggling operation run by the federal government"
102," Companies who arefacilitating the movement of illegal aliens from the southern border to Florida should be held accountable, including by paying restitution to thestate for all the costs they are imposing on our communities"
103," I am also requesting funds so that when the feds dump illegal aliens in Florida, the statecan re-route them to states that have sanctuary policies"
104,Florida should not be made to bear the burden of our federal government’s lawless open border policies
105,The rule of law also means that our citizens have the ability to participate in elections that are secure and transparent
106,"It is Orwellian doublespeak to invoke the concept of “Voting rights” to mean ballot harvesting, prohibiting voter ID and taxpayer funding ofelections"
107, Those are political concepts that erode the integrity of our elections
108,Ballot harvesting has no place in Florida and we need to increase the penalties for those who do it
109," We also need to ensure that supervisors clean thevoter rolls, that only citizens are registered to vote and that mail ballots only go to those who actually request them before each individual election"
110,"To ensure that elections are conducted in accordance with the rule of law, I have proposed an election integrity unit whose sole focus will be theenforcement of Florida’s election laws"
111, This will facilitate the faithful enforcement of election laws and will provide Floridians with the conﬁdencethat their vote will count
112,Our constitutional rights have been under assault on a number of fronts and Florida has stood tall in defending the rights of its people
113,"A free society requires the ability to have robust discussions about issues of public importance, yet today Big Tech companies have used theirplatforms to elevate preferred narratives and to stiﬂe dissent, serving as a de facto council of censors"
114, Florida was the ﬁrst state to legislateprotections for its citizens and we should build on this success
115,These same companies make a fortune by selling user data
116, Floridians should not have their data utilized by Big Tech without providing afﬁrmativeconsent and I urge the Legislature to enact protections for the data privacy of all Floridians
117,I also recommend that the Legislature strengthen protections for Floridians’ 2nd Amendment rights
118, These important rights should not depend on thewhims of politicians who reject the existence of those rights
119,"Finally, we have an opportunity to strengthen protections for the right to life, without which the other rights mean little"
120,Protecting life does not end with the unborn
121, It must also include continued efforts to promote adoption and foster care so that all Floridians have afair chance in life
122," Florida has 4,000 more licensed caregivers than in 2019 and I am proposing additional funds for foster parents in next year’sbudget"
123,"Nobody has done more to support Florida’s children than our First Lady, whose Pathway to Prosperity program has served more than 17,000families in need through a collaboration between DCF and the faith community"
124,"On behalf of our family, I want to personally thank everyone who has sent prayers and well-wishes for her recovery from breast cancer"
125," Casey isstrong, resilient, and has a husband and three kids who love her dearly"
126," 2022 is the year she will be cancer free!Florida has understood how important it is to put our seniors ﬁrst, and we have done that time and again over the past two years"
127,"Most recently, we led the nation in raising awareness of and expanding access to monoclonal antibody treatments"
128, This effort has kept thousands ofseniors out of the hospital and has saved many lives
129,Wally and Doris Cortese from Cape Coral are with us today
130, Wally is a WWII and Korean War veteran who has been married to Doris for 62 years
131,"When they both contracted COVID-19, they utilized monoclonal treatments to make full recoveries"

142,"The grief and anguish endured by the Noriega family and the other Surfside families has been overwhelming, and reminds us that:“The Lord is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those whose spirits are crushed"
143,”Our state should provide support for an appropriate memorial so that future generations will never forget the legacies of the victims of that terribleevent
