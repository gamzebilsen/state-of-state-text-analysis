3, Gov
4, Griffin; Mr
5, Chief Justice Kempand Justices of the Supreme Court; and Members of the General Assembly
6,It is an honor to stand before the joint chambers today for my 8th and final State of the Statespeech
7,For that reason please allow me a moment of personal reflection
8,The opportunity to serve and lead the state I love has been the highest privilege of my publiccareer
9,"As you know, I was raised on a farm on the Spavinaw Creek near Gravette"
10, I was the youngest ofsix children born to John Malcolm and Coral Hutchinson
11," They were married in the GreatDepression and understood tough times; they did not have college degrees but they valuedlearning and encouraged me to pursue my dreams and, most importantly, to have faith and trustin our Creator who reigns sovereign in the affairs of man"
12,But the most important person in my life is the girl I was so crazy about that I hitchhiked fromFayetteville to Memphis on the weekends to see her
13, Susan has celebrated every victory with meand walked with me through every trial
14," Let me introduce my sweetheart of 48 years and theFirst Lady, Susan Hutchinson"
15,"Susan has devoted time, energy, and her voice to helping the abused and neglected children inour state"
16,"My family is important to me, and I am grateful, my son and namesake is here, Asa HutchinsonIII"
17,"1Today, I am also grateful for the partnership of the General Assembly"
18," Every once in a while wedisagree, but all in all, we have worked together and accomplished a great deal for the people ofour state"
19, Our work together has not been for the weak of heart but it has been transformative andwill impact generations to come
20,"Seven years ago, I took office with the desire to improve the quality of life in Arkansas byimproving education, increasing our manufacturing, preserving our outdoor heritage, andsupporting our farmers"
21,"I wanted to be the jobs governor, and through the work of Mike Preston and the ArkansasEconomic Development Commission and our many partners, we’ve had historic success"
22,We now have the lowest unemployment ever at 3
23,1% and a record number of Arkansansworking
24,"We have signed 556 incentive agreements that created 25,000 jobs"
25,"81,000 more people are employed now than when I took office in 2015"
26,"On my first day in office, I called the CEOs of six companies"
27, One of those companies was SigSauer
28,"A year later, they opened a facility in Jacksonville employing Arkansans and continue to grow"
29,The long list of companies that have expanded or moved to Arkansas represents billions ofdollars of investment
30,This is a sampling of the companies that have moved here or expanded- Cynergy Cargo in Crossett
31,- Nestle in Jonesboro
32,- Aerojet Rocketdyne in Camden- Trex in Little Rock
33,- EnviroTech in Helena-West Helena
34,- Vexus Boats in Flippin
35,2- Canoo in Bentonville
36,- Resolute Forest Products in El Dorado and Glenwood
37,- West Rock Coffee in Conway
38,- Riceland in Stuttgart
39,- Mars Petcare in Fort Smith
40,"- Drax in Russellville,- Tractor Supply in MaumelleLast week we broke ground on the largest economic development project in state history"
41, TheU
42,S
43, Steel announcement on the construction of a new steel mill in Osceola
44, This is anothercalling card for our state
45,It means:- A $3 billion investment with more than 900 new high-paying jobs;- Mississippi County will be the Number 1 steel-producing county in the nation
46,- And this would not have been possible without the support of the General Assembly in passinglegislation necessary to win the project
47,  Thank you
48,But there is more
49," In Arkansas, we support our military bases and their missions"
50, That is why weworked so hard to bring in the F-35 pilot training mission to Ebbing Air National Guard Base inFort Smith
51, This will be an economic boon for Western Arkansas for decades to come
52,But another reason that we have been successful in job creation is that we made it a priority tocut taxes
53,When I came into office I promised to cut middle-income taxes by $100 million
54, People said itcouldn’t be done
55," Well, we did it in the first year"
56, Then we went on to provide tax relief to everyArkansan
57, We have lowered the individual income tax rate from 7
58,0% when I was elected to5
59,5% this year
60, And there is more to come
61,3These reductions return money from the government coffers to the hard-working Arkansans whoneed this money to pay for the increasing costs of providing for their family
62, They need fuel toget to work each day and tax cuts allow them to have more money in their pocket to invest orspend on the necessities of life
63,The cumulative total of these annual income tax reductions over the past seven years exceeds $1billion
64,"We did this while also giving teachers raises, increasing funding for education, and creating arecord $1"
65,2 billion reserve fund
66,"In addition, we saw the need for improved roads and highways in Arkansas, so we met thechallenge by doing the heavy lifting of passing the largest highway funding plan in history"
67,We saw the need of our foster children and we gave them HOPE
68,"We wanted a more efficient and responsive state government, so we transformed it from 42departments down to 15"
69," We have reduced the number of state employees by over 2,000 since2015"
70,We navigated our way through a pandemic and we kept our schools open because we knew ourchildren needed to be in the classroom
71," I knew in Arkansas every business was essential, so wenever sheltered in place or stopped producing"
72,These businesses are not only essential for our families but also for the world
73, We produce andthe world depends upon us
74,"In the spirit of comity and friendship, the General Assembly and the Executive Branch came toan agreement on most issues during the last two years; and when we disagreed, well we justdisagreed"
75, But that did not stop the goodwill or our ability to work together
76,"Now, let me pause and recognize 3 representatives of public servants who have sacrificed andendured extraordinary hardship to get us through this pandemic"
77,Let me introduce Juanita Ellison
78, Juanita was a senior in high school in Camden when shedecided she wanted to teach school
79, She earned a degree at Southern Arkansas University
80, She4taught at Camden Public Schools and then moved to Jacksonville where she teaches K-5 specialeducation
81,Juanita Ellison is a dedicated teacher and she represents all of our teachers who have gone theextra mile to help our students
82,Please join me in recognizing Juanita Ellison and saying thanks to our teachers across Arkansas
83,"Next, I want to introduce Emily McGee who is a critical care nurse in the ICU unit of St"
84,Bernard Regional Medical Center in Jonesboro
85, Emily was the director of critical care andoversaw the expansion of critical care at the hospital during the pandemic
86,Emily represents our health care professionals who we all celebrate as heroes during the last twoyears
87, They serve us every day
88, Let’s express our thanks and God bless you
89,Our third and last special guest is Trooper Zenda Staab of the Arkansas State Police
90, Zenda wasan Assistant Basketball Coach before she joined the State Police
91, She is also an MP in theArkansas National Guard
92,Without going into all the details Zenda took heroic actions in 3 separate incidences in order tosave lives
93," In one instance, Zenda initiated the pursuit of a stolen car"
94," When the suspect crossedover to drive against traffic on a four-lane highway, she executed a U-turn and stopped himhead-on with her cruiser"
95, The suspect was traveling 70 mph
96," Before the stolen car stoppedspinning, she was out of her seatbelt, out of the car, and drawing her weapon"
97," The actions ofTrooper Staab, at great risk to her own safety, kept the public safe and saved lives"
98,Please recognize Trooper Staab
99, She represents all those in law enforcement that risk their livesevery day for our safety and to enforce the rule of law
100,"Thank you to Juanita, Emily and Zenda for your service"
101,"Before we move into the future, let’s spend a moment reflecting on history"
102," In 1956, theEisenhower administration laid out a bold plan to change the way Americans moved"
103," TheInterstate Highway System connected all parts of America, even previously remote states likeArkansas"
104, This concept was bold at a time when many Americans traveled interstate by train
105,"Investment in the interstate system helped create unprecedented growth in travel, business, andtourism"
106," Without our interstates, companies like Walmart, J"
107,B
108," Hunt, and FedEx may never have5grown into the business titans they are today"
109," President Eisenhower wisely saw where the futureof mobility was heading, and his vision made America a leader in that future"
110,"Now, let’s talk about our own future"
111, You have supported our students by giving themopportunities in computer science education that make Arkansas a national leader
112, Tens ofthousands of more students have an opportunity to choose a path that will make a difference inshaping the world and will provide them with a high-paying job
113,"But now, Arkansas is in a unique position to lead in future technologies that will change ourworld"
114,"Today, I am challenging Arkansas to lead in this world of innovation by focusing on the future ofadvanced mobility"
115," This focus includes autonomous vehicles, upward mobility platforms, electricvehicles, and modes of transportation that do not exist today but could be the dream of anArkansas student right now"
116,Why Arkansas?We have always led in transportation from entrepreneurs like J
117,B
118, Hunt who started hauling ricehulls from Stuttgart to NWA; and Sheridan Garrison who started Arkansas Freightways that isnow FedEx Freight; and also Steve Williams of Maverick Transportation
119,We all know that the success of our transportation industry is critical to the economic future ofArkansas
120,  And to position our state for the future we must act today because the future of supplychain deliveries will be different tomorrow from the trucks on our road today
121," So, let’s keepleading"
122,"This past year between the Delta variant surge and Omicron, I was able to make an economicdevelopment trip to Israel"
123,  I spoke at the Prime Minister’s Mobility Summit
124, I was preceded onthe stage by the Israeli Transportation Minister who announced that they hope to get a billthrough the Knesset to allow the piloting of autonomous vehicles
125,"Well, I was the next speaker following the Minister and I announced that Arkansas passed a lawin 2019 (2 years ago) that allowed the piloting of autonomous vehicles"
126," Further, the pilotprogram was successful, and we are now using fully automated vehicles delivering goods fromthe warehouse to the retail store"
127, It was a proud moment for Arkansas
128," But to accomplish this, it6took the work of the General Assembly, the Arkansas Department of Transportation, and theleadership of the private sector"
129,"  In this case, Walmart and Gatik"
130,"We have also recruited the headquarters of an electric vehicle manufacturing company, Canoo;and in south Arkansas, Standard Lithium is piloting the production of a critical element in thesupply chain for electric vehicles"
131," In eastern Arkansas, we produce the steel that is required forthe battery casing in electric vehicles"
132," So, we are in a good position to shape the future fromArkansas"
133,"In order for us to lead, we need to have electric charging stations across the state"
134, Arkansas isscheduled to receive $54 million over the next 5 years from the federal government for electriccharging station infrastructure
135," Quite frankly, this needs to be accelerated"
136, Oklahoma already hasit in place and we may need to devote state dollars to get it done more quickly
137,"As governor, I won’t be here for the end of the story but together we can write the first chapter"
138,"Today, I am announcing the creation of the Arkansas Council on Future Mobility"
139," The AdvisoryCouncil will be charged with identifying state laws and regulations that create a barrier to thedevelopment and enhancement of electrification, autonomous vehicles, drone delivery, andadvanced air mobility in Arkansas"
140," It will examine workforce training, accessing federal funding,and will make recommendations before the next general session of the legislature"
141,"In the future, you will have choices to make"
142, You will have the opportunity to remove regulatoryburdens and to pass legislation to advance new modes of transportation that will keep Arkansasin the lead
143, I encourage you to build on the private sector success we have in Arkansas and allowinnovation and new technologies to bolster our future
144, The businesses that drive theseinnovations in mobility will be leaders in the future economy
145, I want these companies to find ahome in Arkansas and for our state to be a leader in future mobility
146,"Of course, the reason we are here is the Fiscal Session of the General Assembly"
147," So, let mediscuss the budget that has been presented"
148,"The budget before you includes increased funding for education, health care and public safety"
149, Itincludes stable funding for the victims of crime through the Crime Victims Reparations program
150,It provides funding for child abduction response teams and for 2 new drug courts
151," And even withthose spending priorities, we will continue to have a healthy surplus"
152,"7Most importantly, this session will be remembered for our support of law enforcement"
153,"Because of your advocacy and hard work, I am able to announce support for the $5,000 one-timepayment to every county and city-certified law enforcement officer"
154, This will be one-timepayment from our surplus effective June 30 when the fiscal year ends
155, It is designed to rewardand incentivize those dedicated officers who keep our streets safe and our homes protected
156, Thetotal costs of this initiative in support of law enforcement will be approximately $45 million
157,"Next, you passed Act 786 of 2021 to create the Public Safety Equipment Grant Program"
158, Thiswas one of the recommendations of the Task Force on the Advancement of Law Enforcementthat I convened after the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent nationwide protests
159," TheTask Force wanted to increase trust between police and our communities and to improve thetraining, equipment and pay for our law enforcement officers"
160,The grant program has received applications for funding to purchase everything from bodycameras to bulletproof vests
161, We have about $5 million in equipment requests from cities andcounties but we don’t have $5 million to cover those grant requests
162, I recommend $10 million ofone-time funding from our June 30 surplus to adequately fund the $5 million in applications andanother $5m for new requests
163,"Currently, our law enforcement is underfunded, underpaid, and underappreciated"
164," The actions ofthis General Assembly to fund more, pay more, and to appreciate more will send theunmistakable message that in Arkansas…"
165,
166,we support and value our law enforcement partners
167,"As part of this effort, our budget will significantly increase the pay of our state troopers"
168, Col
169, BillBryant has been a star in leading the State Police and the troopers are deserving of a morecompetitive salary
170, The troopers not only patrol the highways but their SWAT units are regularlydeployed in crisis situations across the state
171, They back up local law enforcement in the responseand investigation of violent crime
172, I am very proud of their dedication and professionalism
173," So,while some across the country advocate for reducing police funding, we are doing the opposite"
174,We are increasing support and affirming that the first duty of government is public safety
175,I also challenge our counties and cities to step up to the plate and do more
176, Police funding mustbe a priority at every level
177,"8Currently, we have a record back up of state prisoners in our county jails"
178, This limits the countiesand cities in their capacity to enforce local laws
179,"  This backlog must be remedied and for thatreason, I recommend another one-time investment from our surplus to fund a new 498 inmateprison facility"
180,Let me emphasize that this need for a new facility is not a reflection of a change in incarcerationpolicy
181, It is simply the fact that we have a growing state
182, We are growing in projections of 1
183,4%percent
184,My finance team led by Secretary Larry Walther conservatively estimates that we will have a$500 million surplus on June 30
185, We have sufficient room to address these urgent public safetyneeds
186,"And, yes, if this surplus continues to grow then there will be an opportunity next year to returnpart of the growing surplus to the taxpayers"
187,"As to the state of our state, I am grateful to say that Arkansas is leading"
188, We are leading incomputer science education; technology innovation; agriculture; tourism; job creation; andsupport for veterans and law enforcement
189," Sure, we have more to do but our state is blessed"
190,And our nation is blessed as well
191, I think back in my lifetime and I can recall the division andprotests of the Viet Nam War; the turmoil of Watergate; the assassinations of Presidents and civilrights leaders; and the bitter political fights in Washington
192, If you simply concentrated on thosetragic moments in our history then you might be discouraged about America
193, But I alsoremember and lived through the Berlin airlift; the Cuban Missile Crisis when our leaders stoodtall against a Soviet threat; I witnessed Neil Armstrong land on the moon to win the space raceand I saw the fall of the Berlin wall
194, I observed from a very personal standpoint how we all cametogether as a nation after the 9-11 attack
195,"These moments in history remind us that leaders make a difference and that we can do more, andearn the respect of the world when we are united and when we are following the better angels ofthe American spirit"
196,Leaders can appeal to the instincts of fear or they can lead with hope
197," In today’s world and, yes,in Arkansas, let’s join together to bring out the best of our fellow citizens"
198, I have never been9more hopeful and optimistic about the future of our state
199," Let’s work with courage to unite,inspire and lead with hope"
200,Thank you
201," May God bless the state of Arkansas and give us the courage to keep Americastrong, united, and free"
