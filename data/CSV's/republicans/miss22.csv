18, We have bent but we did notbreak
19, We dug deep and we stood tall
20, We got through it all because we decided to getthrough it all together
21,"   That is why, after recession and pandemic and hurricanes and tornadoes, I can still standbefore you tonight and declare, without reservation, and without qualiﬁcation, that the state ofour state is not only strong, but stronger than it has ever been"
22,   I would like to start with what I consider to be the crowning achievement of Mississippi’s ridethrough the pandemic and recession – our educators
23,   It is the most basic promise a state government makes to its people
24, We tell every youngparent: we will be your partner in educating your child
25," Together, we will make sure that if theywork hard, they will learn what they need to know"
26,   It is a solemn promise and one that our state must fulﬁll – and it is a promise that I amdetermined to fulﬁll
27,   We all know that there are many who enjoy criticizing Mississippi
28," They trash our way of life,they trash our institutions, and they frequently deride our education"
29,"   And at times in our past, they might have been at least a little bit right about our educationalsystem"
30," But Mississippi’s schools have made a major turnaround – in fact, a turnaround ofhistoric proportions"
31,"   When you look at the data, it looks like a miracle"
32, But it is not a miracle
33," It is the product ofdedication of our teachers, a result of the intelligence of our people, and conservative,common-sense reforms enacted by many of us here today"
34," And most importantly, it isachievement that was earned by Mississippi students"
35,   Mississippi’s students with disabilities have seen a graduation rate that has doubled over thelast eight years
36," Overall, our graduation rate is now at an all-time high at 87"
37,7 percent
38," That’s,by the way, better than the national average"
39," And while the graduation rate is at an all-timehigh, the dropout rate is at an all-time low of just 8"
40,8 percent
41,   Our passing rate on Advanced Placement exams is also at an all-time high
42,   The number of students who completed career and technical courses has shot up by 36percent since 2015

46,   You all know how fond I am of data
47, I love it
48, I swim in it
49," It’s what I do for fun – and yes, Irealize how uncool that makes me"
50," In fact, just ask my teenage daughters if you have anydoubt about how uncool I am"
51,   But this is not merely data on a page
52, These numbers are real people
53, These are real lives thathave been transformed – and family trajectories that have been forever altered
54,   The Mississippi kids who have out-performed previous generations in the classroom are goingto make our state better as adults
55, We are talking about generational change in careers andhorizons – and it is happening in every corner of Mississippi
56,   I attribute these educational gains to three important factors
57," First, the parents and guardiansof our students"
58," Without you investing in your children’s educations, without you pushing themto be their very best, none of these gains would be possible"
59,   It all starts and ends with parents
60, Mississippi schools and teachers answer to parents
61, Theyare paid for by you
62, They work for you
63,"   It is shocking to me, that in some corners of this country, the basic right of parents to determinetheir child’s education is ignored"
64, We must strive to be better than that
65, We recognize that noclassroom can replace a parent’s care
66," Your voice should not just be heard, it should besought"
67, It should reign
68, All public servants answer to the people
69," In education, we answer tothe parents and as long as I’m governor, we always will"
70,   We’ve also seen these historic gains because of the conservative and effective educationreforms we’ve implemented over the last decade
71,   Expect more and you will get more
72, That is a lesson Mississippi has had to learn
73,   The rigorous reading standards that we put in place have transformed lives and the data proveit
74,"   Since those standards were created, we’ve experienced incredible gains in fourth gradereading"
75," Just a few months ago The Economist noted, Mississippi’s fourth graders rose 20places – from 49th to 29th – on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), andin 2019 we were the “only state in the nation to improve its scores"

79," In 2019, Mississippi was the only state in the nation to improve ourTranslatescores"
80, The only state
81," Out of 50, we were the very best at improving reading scores"
82,   Students of all backgrounds are having academic success in Mississippi
83," According to 2019NAEP results, our students living in poverty are outperforming their peers nationally"
84," Black,white, and Hispanic students from low-income households achieved higher scores than thenational average in all four NAEP subjects"
85,"   For decades we were at the bottom, but now we are not"
86, It takes time to go from last to ﬁrst
87,"But Mississippi kids are on the move, and it is revitalizing our state’s future"
88,"   Now, they say imitation is the sincerest form of ﬂattery"
89," Well, all of you should be ﬂattered"
90,"Again, according to The Economist – and this is a direct quote – “Many states have noticedMississippi’s success and have passed similar legislation"
91,"”   When is the last time you heard that? From Pascagoula to Iuka and from Natchez to Tunica,every single person in Mississippi should be proud"
92,"   These education reforms and the gains they have wrought, is what happens whenRepublicans and Democrats come together"
93," When we set aside our differences, and focus onwhat matters most, there is no limit to what Mississippians can achieve"
94,"   That is why I am asking the legislature to keep it up, and to invest in math coaches, just as wedid for reading, to ensure that we continue to see improved results"
95,   The ﬁnal vital factor in our education gains is our teachers
96," Unlike other states throughout thepandemic, most of Mississippi’s teachers stepped up"
97, They did not cower in fear and refuse tocome into the classroom
98," In fact, it was just the opposite"
99," While other states resorted to Zoomfor years on end, Mississippi’s teachers took to the chalkboard"
100," When teachers in other statessaid, “no we won’t,” Mississippi’s teachers said, “yes we will"
101,"”   They did not walk out, they stepped up"
102, Now I want you to stand up for them
103, I would like foreveryone to take just a moment and give our teachers the applause they deserve

111," In other states, students remained out of the classroom and locked away from theirTranslatePast Issuesteachers and their peers"
112,   But we chose to not let that happen
113," Teachers in Mississippi did not, and will not, back downamid this unprecedented educational battle between a virus and a child’s right to learn"
114,   That is why we must give our teachers the pay raise they deserve
115,   Y’all know that I am a conservative
116, Many of you are too
117," As conservatives, we believe inrewarding hard work and success"
118, There is no doubt that Mississippi teachers ﬁt that mold
119,"   I’m conﬁdent that in this session, working together, we will get a signiﬁcant teacher pay raisedone"
120, It is my number one priority
121," Credit goes to where credit is due and in COVID-19,Mississippi teachers deserve the credit"
122,   There is one cloud on the horizon for our schools and it’s one that we need to address
123,"   Across the country, there is a looming threat in too many schools"
124, It is propaganda that seeksto divide us
125, It’s what’s called critical race theory
126, It doesn’t really matter what you call it
127, AndI’m not interested in semantics
128, I’m interested in the integrity of our civic education
129," In toomany schools in other states, they teach the lie that America is inherently racist"
130, They teachstudents that by virtue of the color of your skin you are inherently a victim or oppressor
131, Theyteach this for a purpose
132,   It is designed to allow a small group of idealogues to pose as saviors—false heroes
133," It isarrogance and ambition, masquerading as education"
134," When you are a victim by birth, only theirgenerosity can save you"
135," When you are an oppressor by birth, only your silent cooperationwith their radical worldview can sanctify you"
136,   There is no country on this earth without sin in its past
137, That is because there is no person onthis earth without sin
138, Sin is inherent in the human condition
139, Injustice is still too present today
140,We must teach that truth
141, We must learn from our history
142,   But we can also proudly teach that America is the ﬁrst nation in history to be born of ideals—not just blood and soil
143," We are not a nation created by a tribe, but a melting pot of peoplecommitted to common purpose"
144,   We work to live up to those ideals every single day
145," Yes, sometimes, we fall short"
146, But then weget up

151, Racism is not unique to America
152, Injustice is not unique to America
153, It is endemicin humanity because humanity is sinful
154, But the American notion that God grants rights that noone can take away – that notion is still transforming the entire planet
155,"   When we teach American children to fear one another because of their skin, we reverse thegreat trend towards achieving our American dream"
156, The promise of America is replaced with avicious lie: that you are doomed to failure or evil based on your race
157," We must stop this trendin its tracks, and we can do our part in Mississippi"
158,"   Today, I am calling on the State Board of Education to adopt the values that combat criticalrace theory in their educational efforts"
159," To afﬁrm that Mississippi’s public educators will notindoctrinate students in ideology that insists this country, or this state, are inherently racist"
160, Wewill not teach that your race determines your status as a victim or oppressor
161, No school districtshall teach that one race is inherently superior or that an individual is unconsciously orinherently racist because of how they are born
162, No child will be divided or humiliated becauseof their race
163," We will strive for equality, and our education will support that aspiration"
164,   This is an important common step we can take to ensure that Mississippi is committed toequality
165," Honesty about our past, and bold and optimistic determination about our future"
166,   The legislature can bolster that effort by passing legislation to this effect
167, We will teach all ofour history — good and bad
168, And that will lead to a brighter future
169, I know that our teacherscan and will lead the way and I ask the legislature to set down that path
170,   These investments in our schools are not a pipe dream
171,   We can afford them
172," We can afford them in large part, because of our economic resilience"
173,   Mississippi continues to be in the best ﬁscal shape and the best ﬁnancial shape in its history
174,Mississippi ended the year a billion dollars over revenue estimates
175,   This was not an accident
176,   We kept our businesses open and helped ensure Mississippians could continue putting foodon their table
177, And they kept working
178," Bravely and calmly and rationally, they put on theirboots, they showed up for work, and our state is better for it"

183," The results are clear:     In November, Mississippi’s weekly unemployment claims reached their lowest point since2018"
184," That’s because, in Mississippi, jobs are plentiful"
185," In the four months after we announcedthe ending of the pandemic unemployment beneﬁts, employers hired at a pace nearly 60percent faster than before the announcement"
186," In the month of June alone, Mississippi’sbusinesses hired more than 72,000 workers"
187, That’s more than any other month in state history

189,"   We should never be satisﬁed until every Mississippian has access to the best jobs, skills, andupward mobility needed to better themselves and their families"

195," A family-supporting career that gives them not just apaycheck, but joy"
196,"   One of the things we should all be able to agree on, is that together, we passed one of themost consequential pieces of workforce development legislation in Mississippi’s history"
197," Whenwe created Accelerate Mississippi, we set our state up to better prepare Mississippians for thejobs of the next 50 years, not the jobs of the last 50 years"
198," Through that legislation, we wereable to streamline our workforce development efforts to ensure we have a clear strategy – astrategy that will meet the needs of employers and ﬁll the vacancies for jobs that offer aboveaverage wages"

215, We need to attract the kind of work that creates wealth for all Mississippians
216,"   First, we need to take care of the basics"
217," We have a historic opportunity to invest in our coreinfrastructure – to take nearly $2 billion of federal money and put it into real, transformativeprojects"
218,"   I want to echo and appreciate the sentiment from Lieutenant Governor Hosemann: We muststay focused on those investments that will have an impact not for one or two years, but forone or two generations"
219, I whole-heartedly support his plan to put the bulk of that money intolocal infrastructure projects that can put those concerns behind us for years
220,   We also need to consider how to attract those companies and economic projects thattransform communities—create generational wealth and lift families out of poverty
221,   This does not just happen one project at a time
222, It takes a bold vision that lasts forever

314," That can not only ﬁll the days, it canset an offender up for a peaceful life on the outside"
315,"   Just last month, Commissioner Cain unveiled a mobile welding training center that will helptrain inmates for a career in welding, post-release"
316, The mobile welding training center – whichby the way was not paid for with taxpayer funds – can train 32 inmates at a time and will rotatebetween prisons every 90 days
317," At the end of the program, trainees who complete it willreceive a certiﬁcation that they can use to ﬁnd a job"
318,   But that’s not the only program we’re leveraging to train inmates

Why should we allocate fundstowards educational opportunities for those who are incarcerated? The answer is actuallypretty straightforward – because it’s a wise investment"
