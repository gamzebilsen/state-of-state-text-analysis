10, He’s directed halftimeshows for nearly half of Camp Randall’s existence and has seen coaches and chancellors and band members come and go
11," But even more than the“stop at the top” or the 5th Quarter post-game routines, The Professor will be remembered for what a remarkable leader, teacher, and inspirer he’sbeen, not just for his students, but for people across our state"
12," So, tonight, we honor The Professor and thank him for his service"

15, Thank you for supporting me — I loveyou all
16,"ADVERTISEMENT News Weather Sports Health Small TownsI’m Tony Evers, and I’m incredibly honored to be here tonight as the 46th governor of the great state of Wisconsin to say the state of our state is thatwe’ve got work to do, and we’re ready for bipartisan solutions"
17,"You know, a few weeks ago, I stood just outside of here where I took the oath of oﬃce and delivered my inaugural address"
18," And I remind you today,just as I did weeks ago, of the spirit of our service, of the power that we have, and the responsibility that we bear"
19,We are a state forged by the Wisconsin Idea -- the notion that education informs our public policy and that knowledge should embrace thecommunities we're called to serve
20," But today, we are also a state among the worst to raise a black family, and we are a state that’s spending moreon corrections than our entire UW System"
21,"We are a state that once cultivated new technology -- from typewriters to automobiles, we’ve led the nation in innovation"
22," But today, we are a statethat’s behind on broadband expansion, and we trail the country in start-ups and small business creation"
23,"We are a state that was the birthplace of BadgerCare, and we’ve been a laboratory for democracy"
24," But today, we are also a state where it’s becomecheaper to get healthcare by driving across the Mississippi River"
25,The realities we face are bigger than me or any political party
26," The magnitude of our challenges requires us to put people ﬁrst because, as I’ve said,that is the promise of our service"
27,"So, tonight, I’m asking you to join me in making good on that promise by moving forward, together"
28,Fixing our economy remains a priority
29," That’s why just last week I directed the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to create aninnovation and entrepreneurship committee focusing on supporting our small businesses, seeding capital funds, and technology development"
30,But there is more to an economy than counting job creation
31, And the state of our state is more than just our unemployment rate
32,"The opportunity we have to oﬀer is not just the number of jobs we create; it’s counted, too, by the number of workers who will work forty hours eachweek and still won’t make enough to keep their family out of poverty"
33,"The strength of our success is not found solely in ﬁscal surplus; it’s deﬁned, too, by the number of our kids who will go to school hungry tomorrow"
34,"The metric for our posterity is not just what we keep in the coﬀers for a rainy day; it’s measured, too, by the quality of the natural resources we’releaving behind for our kids and their kids after them"
35,"ADVERTISEMENTThe state of our state is the work of Lisa, who is also in the gallery tonight"
36, Lisa is the Founder and President of the Foundation for Black Women’sWellness
37," The Foundation serves more than 1,000 women and girls working to eliminate health disparities aﬀecting Black women, their families, andtheir communities"
38," Thank you, Lisa!The state of our state is also the story of Jen, who grew up in Cashton"
39," Because of the Aﬀordable Care Act, Jen has access to comprehensive,patient-centered care that is tailored to her needs"
40, Being able to aﬀord services and insurance has allowed Jen to take control of her health frompreventative to reproductive to behavioral healthcare
41, Jen is also here in the gallery tonight
42,"Thanks, Jen!The state of our state is the story of Jose who came to Abbotsford, Wisconsin, from Mexico with his parents when he was twelve years old"
43, Joselearned English through Abbotsford’s English as a second language program and gained a sense of community when he signed up to play baseballin high school
44, Jose decided to stay here in Wisconsin
45," He still lives in Abbotsford where he’s raising his sons, Marco and Nickolas, and coachestheir baseball team, the Broncos"
46, And he’s become a naturalized citizen
47, Jose and his son Marco are up in the gallery tonight
48," Thanks for being here,Jose and Marco"
49,ADVERTISEMENT News Weather Sports Health Small TownsThe state of our state is the story of students like Alex from Boyceville Middle School
50, Alex’s teacher describes her as having the drive and passionthat make her excited to come to work every day
51," Alex has worked hard to turn things around at school and is now passing all of her classes, has nomissed assignments, and has gone above and beyond to help other students, too"
52, And it’s also the story of students like Diamond from Parker HighSchool in Janesville where the school nurse describes her as the strongest young lady she has the pleasure of knowing
53," Diamond’s family has hadsome tough times, but Diamond has persevered, is excelling in school, and has dreams of becoming a pediatrician or pediatric nurse"
54, Diamond ishere in the gallery and tonight I’m excited to announce Alex and Diamond are the ﬁrst-ever recipients of the Star Student Award in Wisconsin
55,"When I stood before you just a few weeks ago to deliver my inaugural address, I said it was time to get to work"
56, And we have
57,But the real work—the hardest work—is yet to be done
58,"Last month, Mandela and I traveled across the state listening to Wisconsinites talk about their values and their vision for our future"
59, We talked aboutpolicies and solutions that connect the dots
60,And I keep saying that -- connecting the dots -- and I’ve been asked several times what I mean by that -- it’s about seeing a forest through the trees
61,It’s about seeing the connection between how lack of access to aﬀordable housing aﬀects kids in the classroom
62, It’s about seeing the connectionbetween drug and alcohol addiction and our burgeoning criminal justice system
63, It’s about seeing the connection between a budding entrepreneurwho wants to start their own business and how the rising costs of health insurance might push that dream out of reach
64,The budget that I’ll be introducing in the coming weeks is about connecting those dots
65," And to no one’s surprise, it begins—as it always has for me—with education"
66,Connecting the dots means recognizing that what’s best for our kids is best for our state
67, The investment we make in our kids today will yielddividends for generations
68, That’s why our budget reaﬃrms our state’s commitment to our kids by returning to two-thirds funding for schools acrossWisconsin
69,"I was pleased to learn that the Speaker has encouraged his members to support this provision in our budget, and I hope that I can count on yoursupport going forward"
70,"In addition to two-thirds funding, we’re also going to make sure that we have resources to support our kids with special needs"
71," For the past decade,we’ve not only cut funding for public schools, we've failed to fully fund services for special education"
72, This has forced local school districts andtaxpayers to squeeze resources from other areas to provide these critical services
73, Our budget will provide an unprecedented $600 million-dollarincrease in special education funding
74, That means our school districts will have enough to allocate the resources they do have to other areas of highneed
75,And we’re not just going to increase support for our kids with special needs
76, We’re going to get to work on closing the achievement gap for low-income students and students of color
77, Our state’s achievement gap is among the highest in the nation in reading and math scores
78," As StateSuperintendent, I submitted proposals that would’ve helped address our state’s achievement gap"
79,"Unfortunately, most of these proposals never made it through the Legislative process"
80, I believe this is the year they will
81, And my Urban Initiativesprograms will also empower minority students in our state’s highest-need districts by expanding early childhood education and summer school grantprograms
82,ADVERTISEMENTIt is urgent that we increase support for our low-income students and students of color
83," The longer we wait to invest in closing our achievement gap,the wider the gap will get, and the more it will cost us in the long-run"
84,"Finally, we’re going to propose a ﬁve-fold increase in mental health programs for K-12 students across our state"
85," But funding mental healthprogramming in our schools is not enough; so tonight, we renew our commitment to making sure everybody has access to quality, aﬀordablehealthcare"
86,We’ve already started working to make sure healthcare in Wisconsin is aﬀordable and accessible
87, We signed executive orders creating a HealthyCommunities Initiative and calling upon the Department of Health Services to prioritize these goals
88, We also called upon our state agencies toconnect the dots and work together on how we can protect healthcare coverage for people in our state
89,But our work can’t stop there
90, That’s why our budget will also seek to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin
91," According to the nonpartisan Legislative FiscalBureau, this will enable an additional 76,000 Wisconsinites to have access to aﬀordable healthcare"
92," This would also save Wisconsin taxpayershundreds of millions of dollars, allowing us to reallocate those cost savings to other critical programs"
93,"ADVERTISEMENT News Weather Sports Health Small TownsWe have a real opportunity here, folks"
94," At the end of the day, Mr"
95, Majority Leader and Mr
96," Speaker, healthcare should not be a partisan issue --Republican states like Kentucky, Nebraska, and Idaho have expanded Medicaid, and so have Democratic states like Washington, California, andMinnesota"
97," We should be able to get it done here, too"
98,The people of Wisconsin voted for a change this November and asked us to stop playing politics with their health care
99, That’s why I’m announcingtonight that I have fulﬁlled a promise I made to the people of Wisconsin by directing Attorney General Kaul to withdraw from a lawsuit that would gutcoverage for the 2
100,4 million Wisconsinites who have pre-existing conditions
101, I’ve said all along that I believe the best way to maintain protections forhealthcare here in Wisconsin is to stop trying to dismantle those protections at the federal level
102,"In addition, we’re also going to address Wisconsin’s transportation funding crisis"
103,I appointed Secretary-designee Craig Thompson because I know that he will work on both sides of the aisle for a solution that works for Wisconsin
104, Ifully expect that he will be approved with consent of the Senate
105,"I’ve said all along that I believe we have to bring people together to work on this issue, and I believe Secretary-designee Thompson can get it done"
106,"In the coming days, we’ll be announcing a task force of stakeholders to get to work on proposing a bipartisan policy solution to be included in ThePeople’s Budget"
107," The task force will solicit feedback from key partners from all regions of the state, all sectors of the economy, and users of alldiﬀerent modes of transportation"
108,"And while I know that caucus members in both houses support diﬀerent approaches to solving our transportation funding crisis, it’s going to takesacriﬁces and compromises to ﬁnd a long-term, comprehensive solution that works for everyone"
109,But roads and bridges are only a small part of the infrastructure challenges facing our state
110, That’s why I’m also declaring 2019 is the Year of CleanDrinking Water in Wisconsin
111,"According to the Department of Health Services, 1"
112,"7 million Wisconsinites depend on private wells for water, and 47% of these wells do not meetacceptable health standards"
113," Meanwhile, according to the U"
114,S
115," Environmental Protection Agency, we have an estimated 176,000 lead service linesacross our state"
116, Removing lead service lines could cost over $2 billion
117," But Pew Charitable Trusts estimates that for every $1 we spend on replacinglead drinking water lines, we will see a 133% return on our investment in higher lifetime earnings and better health outcomes"
118,"That’s why, in the coming weeks, I’ll be signing an executive order to designate a person at the Department of Health Services to take charge onaddressing Wisconsin’s lead crisis and to help secure federal funding for prevention and treatment programs"
119,"Finally, we’re going to cut taxes by ten percent for everyone making up to $100,000 and families making up to $150,000"
120, But we’re not going to do itby spending money we don’t have or that might not be there in two years
121," I don’t make promises I can’t keep, and I’m not going to propose thingsthat we can’t pay for"
122," So instead, we’re going to fund tax relief for hard-working families by capping a corporate tax credit, 80% of which goes toﬁlers making more than $1 million a year"
123,"An economy that works for all of us, healthier communities, more money for our kids and our schools, better roads and infrastructure -- that is whatthe people of Wisconsin expect from us, and that is what the people of Wisconsin deserve"
124,"Given the challenges we face, I expect the Legislature will focus on these important priorities instead of being distracted by division and preventingus from working together to get things done"
125,"You know, in the Governor’s conference room inscribed on the ceiling is a phrase that reads, “The will of the people is the law of the land"
126,”The will of the people is the law of the land
127,That means I expect legislation arriving on my desk will be passed with broad support and in the spirit of bipartisanship
128,"That means instead of taking up an entirely new budget of its own, I expect the Legislature to take up the budget I crafted by and with the people ofour state"
129,I’ll tell you today as I told you a few weeks ago that I have never been more hopeful about our state and our kids’ future
130, I have no doubt that therewill be issues on which we disagree
131, I have no doubt that there will be times when we will be frustrated by the deliberative process of democracy
132,But we will engage civilly
133," We will have discourse and dialogue, but it will not devolve into disrespect"
134, And we will govern with a humble appreciationthat the will of the people -- our people -- is the law of the land
135,"Now, let’s get back to work"
136," Thank you, and On, Wisconsin!Republican Response from Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester)As provided to Action 2 NewsHello,I’m Assembly Speaker Robin Vos"
137, I’m honored to give the Republican response tonight
138,"As I’ve travelled our great state this past year, I’ve seen Wisconsin at its best"
139, Our state and its people are thriving
140," In northeastern Wisconsin,Marinette Marine is expanding and building the future of our nation’s naval ﬂeet"
141," Outside Lambeau Field, the Titletown development is taking shapeand attracting visitors, even, in the oﬀ-season"
142," In Milwaukee, the Fiserv Forum is having an amazing inaugural season especially with the MilwaukeeBucks having the best record in the NBA"
143," Throughout Wisconsin, many farmers had their ﬁrst growing season of HEMP in more than 70 years"
144,Business owners across the state are increasing pay to meet the demand in our competitive market place
145, Wisconsin now has more jobs thanpeople to ﬁll them
146, It’s clear: the state of our state is strong
147, News Weather Sports Health Small TownsYou simply can’t ignore the facts
148, The Wisconsin unemployment rate is at its 11th straight month at or below 3 percent
149, New businesses are upnearly 7 percent
150, We’re seeing the fewest mortgage foreclosures in 18 years
151, Exports have increased by 3
152,2 percent
153, Tourism spending now tops 20billion dollars
154, And Wisconsin families have the lowest tax burden in nearly 50 years
155, Economists agree that the state economy is the best indecades
156,"You might ask, how did we get here? For the last eight years, Republicans worked hard to make Wisconsin open for business"
157, We cut taxes by morethan $8 billion
158,"We made investments in worker training, froze college tuition and made the largest investment ever in K-12 education in actual dollars"
159, Wisconsin ison a roll and Republicans will not allow it to slip backwards
160," We’re committed to keeping your taxes low, the state pension fully funded and ourbudget balanced"
161," We can increase our investment of K-12 education to two-thirds funding, without raising income or sales taxes"
162,"As President Ronald Reagan once said, “As government expands, liberty contracts"
163,"” He also said, “Freedom is never more than one generationaway from extinction"
164,” Republicans in the legislature won’t forget Ronald Reagan’s sentiments
165, We won’t let government grow out of control and wewon’t let socialism to take root in our state
166,"I promise you: Republicans will ﬁght for and protect your freedom, from unnecessary red ﬂag gun laws to the expansion of government-run andcontrolled health care"
167," We will keep spending in check, continue our successful school choice programs and most importantly, protect the unborn"
168,"However, we know that when voters chose divided government, they didn’t choose inaction"
169," In November, the voters said they want us to ﬁnd waysto work together"
170," That’s why only days after the inauguration, Assembly Republicans sent Governor Evers a letter outlining areas where we thoughtwe could ﬁnd agreement"
171," It’s my hope that we focus on issues that don’t divide our state, instead we focus on issues that are easy to ﬁnd commonground"
172, The 11 ideas that we proposed in the letter aren’t meant to be an exhaustive list but a starting point
173," Things like enhancing internet access,preventing homelessness, improving foster care, and cutting middle class taxes should all be slam dunks"
174, Wisconsinites want us to work togetherand these are shared priorities that we can begin working on
175,"This past week, Assembly Republicans moved forward on a middle class tax cut using the governor’s framework"
176," Unlike Governor Evers’ originalproposal, our plan doesn’t raise taxes on farmers or manufacturers"
177, It uses the GOP surplus to pay for it
178," The tax cut is targeted to families makingunder $150,000 and individuals making under $100,000"
179, It saves a married couple with a median income more than $300 annually
180, We can make thismiddle class tax cut a reality
181,Another shared priority is protecting the insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions
182, Assembly Republicans promised that it would be the ﬁrst billwe pass this session; and we did just that earlier today on a bipartisan vote of 76 in favor and 19 against
183, The Assembly approved this billguaranteeing access to insurance for individuals with pre-existing conditions regardless of what happens to ObamaCare
184,The bill also eliminates any annual or lifetime cap on health insurance in Wisconsin
185, There should be no reason why Governor Evers doesn’t sign thepre-existing conditions bill passed with a strong bipartisan majority or approve a middle class tax cut that he proposed and paid for by the GOPsurplus
186,Tonight Governor Evers said he expects the legislature to take up the budget that he crafts quote “by and with the people of our state”
187," We willconsider the ideas in his budget but unfortunately, his ideas are only focusing on one side of the aisle and not the vast majority of Wisconsin"
188," If hisbudget is merely a tax-and-spend wish list, one that would never pass this legislature, his budget would amount to political gamesmanship and thewords of bipartisanship he said tonight will ring hollow"
189, Every person who runs for public oﬃce wants to change their part of their world for thebetter
190,One of my ﬁrst introductions into politics was by my sixth grade teacher in Burlington
191, She told me everyone in the United States has a chance tomake a diﬀerence
192," In our system, good people run for oﬃce because they want to do things and better the lives of their family, friends andneighbors"
193,Democrats want that
194, Republicans want that
195, Every Wisconsinite wants that
196,That’s why I’m so worried that hate and vitriol have become far too pervasive on social media these days
197, I believe it discourages people fromentering the public arena and ﬁghting for their ideas
198, We all want what’s best for Wisconsin: so let’s do a better job listening to one another andunderstanding each other’s perspective
199,"In closing, let me reiterate tonight what Republicans are going to work for over the next two years"
200, We will work to keep the tax burden lower andaﬀordable for the middle class
201, We will protect those with pre-existing conditions
202, We will make record investments in K-12 education
203, And we willmove Wisconsin forward
204,Thank you for joining me
205,God Bless you and your family and God Bless the state of Wisconsin
