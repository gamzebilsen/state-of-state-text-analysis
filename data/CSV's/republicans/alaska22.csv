31, Theperformance of the Permanent Fund solidiﬁes our state government’s ﬁscal situation by smoothing out the highsand lows in oil prices
32, The outstanding returns of our pension funds are freeing up revenue that can be devotedto core government responsibilities like Public Safety and Infrastructure without imposing taxes
33, This just didn’thappen on its own
34, It’s not an accident
35," It’s the result of great investment decisions, policies, vision, anddirection"
36,"”Tourism Recovering“In the near future, our $4"
37,5 billion tourism industry is poised to welcome millions of travelers back to Alaska

40, My administration acted last August before the surge fully hit when we took decisiveaction after receiving a notiﬁcation that health care workers were available
41, We consulted with the state hospitalassociation to identify their needs and secured nearly 500 contract professionals covering specialties fromnurses to respiratory therapists
42," After ﬁnalizing the contract in September, it took less than a month for us todeploy these workers around the state to our hospitals, nursing homes, and the Department of Corrections justin time to deal with the surge"

52, It’s not theState’s job to make those decisions for you
53, My administration’s job is to make sure our health care system isstrong and you have the tools available to take care of yourself

58, One of the promises I made when I ranfor this oﬃce was to ensure that government works for the people
59,"Thanks to our Health Department, we turned that situation around"

64, We’ve done this
65, My proposed budget for statespending in the next ﬁscal year is 7 percent less than the 2019 budget in place when I took oﬃce

83,"Back in 2013, after years averaging 6 percent annual production declines, the forecast for production in thecurrent ﬁscal year was projected to be just 340,000 barrels per day"
84," Instead, we are in fact, around 500,000barrels, with multiple large projects in development and billions of barrels still in the ground"
85," If allowed to cometo fruition, these projects can add more than 300,000 barrels per day in production"
86," Ten years ago, some had theidea that policy didn’t matter, that the oil was running out and the decline was inevitable"

95, We must be preparedfor that inevitability
96, We must be self-suﬃcient
